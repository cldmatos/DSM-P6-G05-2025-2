to Play,RPG,Indie,Pixel Graphics,2D,Economy,MMORPG",Damascus is set in a post apocalyptic fantasy future where the destruction of the past has knocked society into a medieval state of living Many creatures have gained sentience in this timeline leading to the rise of frogman catsons owlpeople and many other races Over time humans have developed psychic abilities that they can invoke with the use of mechanical psychic actuators these psychic abilities allow them to summon fire or teleport to new locations among many other powers The destruction of this world was caused by Dark Gods of sacrifice known as the Gods of Destruction the player can sacrifice items to these entities in order to receive powerful boons from them The apocalypse was thousands of years in the past and many of those living today have very little to no knowledge of the events that transpired or the fact that there even was an apocalypse Design Goals Our goal is to create a MMO experience that rings true to how classic tabletop Dungeons and Dragons feels with weekly meetups where the dungeon master is creating new custom content for his players taking their decisions and desires into account We want to have a very active community and will be working very hard to interact directly with the players of the game We also want to implement new concepts like temporary bosses that drop limited edition items Controls Left Click to perform the most obvious action on a given tile Right click to bring out a dropdown menu of all possible actions for a given tile Tab to show or hide the sidebar FAQ Here is a little set of common questions about the game in a FAQ format We thought this would be an easy way to get across a lot of information How do you guys make money We sell bonds which grant membership The bonds are redeemable for 14 days of membership and can be traded with other players if you so desire This means its feasible to do an in game activity for someone who has already bought a bond and trade them for the bond as payment for the activity as a means to become a member What is membership Membership is the full game experience and unlocks access to all of the in game skills and grants access to the entire game world Money made from membership helps us cover the server costs and really helps us out Will you ever sell experience or items directly No we will not The only thing we will sell are bonds The value of a bond in game is determined by the players and what they are willing to trade for them The only way to gain experience or items will be to play the game We dont believe in selling power What are your goals in terms of membership Our biggest goal would be to get 500 monthly members which would allow us to cover all our server costs and both work on the game full time Any members over this amount would be an absolute blessing What happens when I die in game All of your currently equipped and all items in your inventory will be dropped and you will respawn in Split City Will you reimburse my items if I die and lose a lot of them No we will not dying in game and losing items is part of the game and its up to you to bank important items you dont wish to lose How many towns are there in game There are 14 towns currently in the game What happens if I forget my password As long as you provided your email address when creating your account we can reset your password for you At a later stage we will facilitate linking your Steam account to your Damascus account which will provide extra security and password retrieval mechanisms Why arent you guys doing Early Access The way we view MMORPGs is that they are inherently a service Our goal is to constantly update the game as long as it is live Due to this we didnt want to be yet another permanently in early access game and have decided to have the first stable version of the game be our release version with many updates and future content already in the pipeline How often will you update the game We plan to update the game every couple of weeks with new content however this is a loose timeline and it could be shorter or longer depending on the content we are currently working on We intend to be very active on Discord so you can always ask us directly about what we are working on and approximately when you can expect the next update Will you ever expand the world map Yes we do plan to at some stage release new Islands and Continents which will expand the scope and scale of the game However these updates will take some time to implement and most likely come with new quests as some of our larger updates to the game Will I get banned for selling in game items for cash to my friends No you wont All in game items earned by you belong to you and you a responsible for them this means you are free to give them away or sell them to other people and it also means that its your responsibility to not lose your items in silly ways like attacking a Damascus Steel Dragon at a low level Will I get banned for usingcreating a third party client We wont be supporting third party clients and we would consider this a bannable offense The only version of the client one should use is the Steam version Will I get banned for macroing or botting Macros that make the game easier as well as botting are not in the spirit of the game and are considered a bannable offense We suggest avoiding macroing entirely

Texas Holdem Poker Solo King,20200304,0.0,12.99,,,,,,,The game consists of two parts 1 In the console game section you can play tournament games and headsup games against professionallevel AI opponents 2 A complete set of Texas Holdem calculation tools The table below shows the functional price comparison between the computing tools in the game and other Texasrelated computing products on the market Help players solve two problems 1 Have a complete tool chain You have purchased a complete set of Texas Holdem calculationrelated tools at a very cheap price and it calculates correctly and runs stably It is cheap comprehensive and convenient One account can share data on multiple platforms and the functions are consistent and there is no castration 2 Learn the playing strategies of professional poker players You only play games with professionallevel AI and learn the playing strategies of professional poker players There is no random behavior to confuse you with entertaining AI and I dont want to waste your time Satisfy player pursuit and advancement 1 When players play Texas Holdem they just want to find and master a set of playing strategies that suit their profession The professional AI I wrote is written in accordance with the standard textbookstyle playing strategies of professional poker players and they are all in standard poker scenarios fixed action paradigm It is very fixed not random which helps you quickly understand the playing strategies of professional players to learn this strategy Your discovery and learning of patterns will not be interfered with by random strategies Dont think its going to be silly it plays a lot better than most players in online real money games You can buy it on steam to try its AI capabilities if you are not satisfied you will get an unconditional refund within 2 hours you have nothing to lose at all This AI uses standard and mature textbook play to fight against you You can learn the AIs play understand the AIs play and find your own way of defeating the AI It all depends on your own understanding and ability The AI  is not responsible for providing you with the thrill of victory it is up to you to win The more games you play in the world of online real money gaming the more severely you feel you are bound you feel right you are almost all playing with a group of professional players who rely on a full suite of scientific tools to give realtime calculations and decisionmaking cues playing It was people who were heavily armed like me In fact the AI  strategy in this game basically covers all my action strategy logic I wrote it to greatly reduce the energy consumption of my decisionmaking in the poker game The strategies in this game are extremely effective at PokerStars blind levels below 1020 Further up I dont want to play games with too much stake so I cant stand up effectively so I dont level up 2 You have learned strategies and you need a complete set of tools to assist you Without scientific calculation tools in real money poker games you have strategies and dare not use them The essence of Texas Holdem is a real mathematical probability game Data and calculations determine the choice of strategies In the past two years the Texas Holdem books handwritten by foreign professional players who have been translated by the player groups on Taobao are very expensive far more expensive than my game Those books cost hundreds of yuan and they are still very popular This marks that although the state strictly prohibits Texas games players pursuit of strategic knowledge has not stopped They provided some foreign poker experience and strategies and I provided a professional training ground and toolset that also filled the gaps for the Chinese in terms of Texas science tools 3 Optics does not practice it is natural to learn and it is valuable to apply what you have learned You donAt know whether you are cheating or not and you donAt know why you win or lose Basically you are just playing for nothing In this game you can freely organize the table freely set the blind level freely set the hand range of each opponent freely set the opponents AI type and freely set your own hand range so that every time the card is dealt the Youre dealt hands in this range and youre also free to set one of the 20 good hands so theres a definite training In the game the various win rate data listening win rate and EV data of each player on each street are calculated in real time saving you the trouble of manual calculation and also giving you AI decisionmaking suggestions from professionallevel textbooks These ensure that you can train fully on demand and judging whether it makes sense for you The complete display of this information in the game also helps you analyze the game so that you know the logic of your winning and losing where you win and where you lose Dont think that you lost it was me who cheated you can understand whether I cheated by reading the data and graphs carefully you cant understand these either you have no knowledge of technology and playing cards or your understanding is too poor what Its all clear you still cant understand it and its clear that you dont have the ability to think and you cant play IQ games so dont waste time torturing yourself Tell you clearly 1 I sell strategies and tools and I show you professional strategies in the game 2 The game is sold at a fixed price Even if you lose all the chips and diamonds the server will continue to supply chips and diamonds for you to play There will be no extra charge I dont need to cheat you for chips and diamonds at all I dont even bother with it 3 The chips and diamonds provided are enough for you to play 50000 hands You need about 500 hours to play them all For the vast majority of players they will not spend 500 hours on a certain game They do not give you a huge amount The chips and diamonds are also to bring you closer to the real world to play from small stacks so that it makes sense 4 It is not a multiplayer online crowd gambling game but a console game or more precisely a training tool The networking function ensures that you can freely share usage data between your mobile phone and computer This game is more precisely a training tool and a tool for assisting actual combat calculation and strategy I have provided you with a trainer aircraft and a fighter jet and it is up to you to combine your wisdom ability and financial resources to control and use it to assist you If you think you want to train yourself and experience the brutality of professional gambling then you can play hard It provides you with the basic prerequisite knowledge skillstrategy mix training environment and toolsets you need from beginner to pro As a poker tool the existing functions have completely covered the calculation and decisionmaking functions of the whole process and all stages required for scientific training and realtime battles At least its completely enough for me There is no longer any free on mobile 1 Before the V4 version a free google play version was provided for the convenience of steam players to download the mobile version for free and for some users who were unwilling to pay to experience the function for free The new version of V4 will be forced to upgrade from the beginning and the old mobile phone version will not be able to log in Old users who pay for it need to ask me for it 2 Now I dont offer any free versions on all platforms Now the computer and mobile phones have the same functions and the google play also has the same price on steam But you only need to buy the steam version then you can send me a letter to ask for the corresponding android mobile version When asking for the android version you need to provide a screenshot of your purchase history on the steam platform to prove it Just send me a screenshot of the purchase record information in the email 3 All versions are unified as paid versions and the price is the same which ensures the rights and interests of paying players and the quality level of players 4 On February 26 2022 the new version of the server was updated to Alibaba Cloud with 4 cores of 8G 10M dedicated bandwidth 80G cloud disk and a 3year lease so the service for at least the next three years is guaranteed If you are a streamer and have some fans you

VR Time Machine Travelling in history Medieval Castle Fort and Village Life in 10711453 Europe,20200731,0.0,9.99,,,,,,,European castles are known for their mysterious brilliance Many castle owners are either kings nobles ministers or princesses Each has its own ancient legend about them However in the millennium the hustle and bustle of the past has long been silent and their masters have turned into dead bones Castles are everywhere in Europe and you can find them on the mountains on the beach and even around the ancient cities Perhaps some castles are in disrepair to varying degrees but they are no less than wellpreserved classics However the European architectural styles are strikingly elegant in the Middle Ages Imagine the huge Gothic cathedral and the magnificent castle which are the protagonists of fairy tales The ancient castles in Europe originated from the military camps of ancient Rome In the late Roman Empire the Romans built some large permanent camps in the border provinces Most of these camps are square and each camp has a garrison camp This can be seen as the predecessor of the later castle After the demise of the Roman Empire many countries appeared in the place of Rome and the entire Western Europe was in a state of chaos In such a chaotic situation princes and nobles everywhere began to build castles to protect themselves Most of the castles in the early Middle Ages were built with civil materials and were built on a large rammed earth foundation called a dike Some castles are rammed with mud and more are built with wood There are tall towers built inside the fort and some living facilities such as the main hall stables and churches are also built beside the tower A moat was dug around the castle The fatal weakness of these wooden castles is that they cannot withstand fire The 9th century was a period of great castle development and the major improvement in castle construction technology was the advent of the stone castle After the castle is built it can not only protect the lords and their families but also be used to control the surrounding area Usually the nearby manor produces the items needed in the castle and the farmers in the manor in the wartime will flee to the castle to seek protection The medieval castle in Europe is a building with both military and civilian functions It is not only a fortress used to defend against enemy attacks but also a residence for nobles and knights Medieval Europe was a wild place full of conflict robbery confrontation and killing In this kind of chaos people need to avoid the harbor of war storms tools to resist the attack of strong enemies and maintain a weapon of peace and tranquility As a result the castle came into being At that time building a castle was the most reliable defense in the war and at least the weaker side could retreat to the castle The earth and stone materialbased castle is enough to resist the cavalrys rapid attack and transform the raidtype quick decisive battle into the attrition battle Therefore the purpose of the castle is to defuse the attack of the enemy especially in medieval Europe Lords at all levels take the security of the territoryAs personal property as the core task and make the castle enter the golden age From the 11th century to the 13th century the development of the castle entered its heyday For a time castles were scattered all over Western Europe Many of the best medieval castles preserved to this day are in Wales England In the late 13th century King Edward I of the United Kingdom sent troops to conquer Wales Every time he attacked the ground he had to choose a key place to build a castle to form a siege of Wales In this game we can visit the style of the medieval castle at any time according to our own time Realistic VR scenes can let you devote yourself to the scene of the castle Inside you can visit the castle according to your own wishes and your own ideas Everywhere if you feel tired during the tour you can stop and rest

minute some small tumors can heal their creator giving their life in return If you attack their mother they will sense this and rush to defend her even at the end of the world So the sooner you team up and destroy the tumors the better before they spread all over your body Adenovirus is a rare virus that wanders through the organism at high speed its not dangerous if you dont attack it yourself If it takes damage it will release deadly spikes But if you can catch up to it and destroy it youll be well rewarded HIV Human Immunodeficiency Virus the main and most dangerous virus it is alone but can harm and destroy the android body so it must be destroyed before the Egg is captured It has a huge amount of life and can severely cripple you if touched also beware of its projectiles they burn through the suit As his life dwindles he goes crazy and begins to frantically rush from side to side sweeping away everything in his path try to dodge it After his death everyone who caused damage and stayed in the game until the end of the capture eggs share the reward commensurate with the damage caused Optimal monetization Absolutely all ingame items and costumes can be purchased for ingame currency you only need to accumulate the required amount of ingame premium money Zions which in most cases can be earned by capturing Egg Cells or completing assignments Note that in the auction items are sold and bought for another nonpremium and easier to obtain currency Ions Costumes There are a lot of costumes skins in the game you can transform your sperm cell in a suit that suits you best whether it be an astronaut suit or a pirate costume We are constantly adding new costumes Drones Sometimes on the map there are boxes with drones be careful and when you find one you will be able to open and get a drone comparable to the rank of your found box Each of the 4 levels of box has its own time to capture the higher the level the longer you need to hold the box You can move during this time run and fight but all players will know that you picked up the drone box Drones always stay with you even if youre killed they help you for example the drone Scanotron 3000 scans your enemies determining what kind of capsules they have unless of course the enemy has an  ntiscan  capsule of the proper level or the drone Mechanic which repairs the suit We are constantly improving the game

is a game about an operation for rescuing a princess kidnapped by monsters in a fantasy desert kingdom The hero user must solve numerous puzzles and deal with countless monsters to complete the operation It combines adventure puzzles and RPG elements Please find the introduction of the story below the following features We also had the story written as a novel which might be available to you While it is essentially an adventure game we incorporated lots of RPG elements to enrich the content of the game like the drops of elixirs herbs potions and mixtures As we know that a game must offer replayability in the future we tried to randomize many things like enemies objects locations characters including the title songs some dialogs and other sounds Surrounding objects will offer many surprises that are randomized carefully We used highly diversified sound assets and voiceovers of all characters were done by carefullyselected artists with special skill in their profession Enemies are many and they have special melee or magic skills depending on their character or maybe boss We included numerous cutscenes to tell the story nicely and enjoyably We incorporated special animations to people and monsters with different activities in line with the particular things they do like mining We attached particular importance to the bosses We wanted them to be a little different from classical bosses with supreme power and converted them into intelligent and interesting beings ranging from the one who vomits similar but smaller monsters to the one who converts the objects in the interior of the castle into enemies and from the one who cooks enemies in a huge magic cauldron to the one who becomes the hero himself The game is assertive especially with its puzzles Introduction of the story Excerpt from our novel Chapter 1 Curse befallen Anyone who would take look at the view of the Castle of Seven Dunes could see it looked uglier darker and gloomier than a few weeks earlier with its artisanal architecture and build made of the golden sands of the desert following the fulminant curse spiderwebbed all around the locale One of the centers of happiness and justice in Seven Dunes had turned into chilling somberness behind the western walls of the town The people of Seven Dunes were unwilling to see it any longer In fact no one was feeling like a bit of fresh air coming outside from their homes that they were probably considering the safest place for the time being The gate at the eastern walls was opening to a temple that looked a bit larger than the one a visitor of the town would expect as a significant portion of the townsfolk was imprisoned or lost The gate at the southern walls was the passageway of the people to an oasis where they could fulfill their needs of bathing trading breeding their livestock and enjoying conversations with the foreign passersby of other kingdoms of the desert The land beyond the northern walls did not offer much for a visitor as it was mere sand and endless view of the desert despite the presence of a nice pavilion for public meetings situated on the northern dune one of the seven dunes encircled by the walls which were the inspiration for elders to name the town The southern dune also had a pavilion on it where Anderyn the female Chief of the town or other individuals met to govern the locale Four of other dunes were home to the housing of the townsfolk while the last one was used as the entrance to the castle in the west There situated inns merchants workplaces market etc as well as palm trees on the fords naturally formed between the dunes In the middle of the night one of the rooms somewhere in the castle was lit with numerous candlesticks Seven Dunes as always in lands dominated by deserts more particularly the hot weather during daytime was shinier and more cheerful at nights and recent days saw the townsfolk tired and less willing to enjoy things under the control of unknown beings The room was the one where Princess Elryn the Governor and Ruler of Seven Dunes under the aegis of King Gorlough her father who was in charge of all kingdoms and princedoms of the desert was kept as a prisoner Princess Elryn had fallen in love with Seven Dunes and wanted to lead her life there in a visit her father paid together with her Indeed Seven Dunes was also home to the endless goldcolored sands of the desert but its proximity to the oasis and the small creek running from it entering the town and passing by the font side of the temple were able to make the area fertile enough and the people continue living in peace Now the princess was imprisoned in her own castle in a part of it she even did not discern That night she wrote a letter to her father  My lord Seven Dunes is in danger All of a sudden some unknown creatures started to appear everywhere They first imprisoned me in the depths of the castle And made weird shapes on walls They built their statues arbitrarily everywhere Wanting us to witness the presence of their vile shadow In the desert in the caves in the gardens even in my castle They say they keep destroying everything in my kingdom They occupied every nook and cranny And inflicted undefinable damage and suffering on my people and my land I do not know where they hide and attack hideously And I also do not know where they emerge from Please Excellency please help my people survive Your force is my only chance and shelter As always Faithfully yours Princess Elryn Princess Elryn then stood and took the letter as well as a living thing that was not unfamiliar to the royal people of the region a Crystalbird She had bluish bright crystal feathers and body parts and was shedding more light than the torch on the walls of the room and the candlestick on the table of the Princess Crystalbirds were one of the means of communication among nobles AHow unfortunate it is that this is the only Crystalbird I have  she thought to herself fearing that the
