Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten... Key Features Action -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H. R.

There is some valuable data stored on your server. Your task is to protect this data from malicious programs which will try to steal it. Some of them will try to use brute force their way through your defenses. Most, however, will use more sophisticated algorithms. Some of them can be quick, others are well aware of your defenses and will therefore avoid attacks, and some more still you will not notice at all. And remember that it is not only you who can patch your system Ã‚Æ’?? your enemies are not standing still, too. Their creators are constantly studying your security utility programs and release more advanced versions. A deep and hardcore tower defense gameplay. A variety of enemies. A giant skills tree. Patches for the Patches God! (And all of them are really useful :) ) An unusual visual style. Every level has its own unique dressing which not only looks good but also moves in tune with the soundtrack. Hotkeys. Camera control: arrows or w, a, s, d. Pause: p. How to play. Your system is targeted by malicious programs. Every one of these programs aims at stealing data from your storage. Your task is to not let them do that. For this, you have: 1. Towers. Three left icons in the level menu. There are 3 types of towers: Red, Green, Blue. A tower of a specific type can only be built on a tile of the same color. The only exception are 'high tiles'. On a tile of this type you can build a tower of any type (this is why such tiles are of a special color). Also, a tower build on such a tile gets an attack range bonus. To build towers, you spend Memory. For each shot, you get experience. When a tower gets enough experience to upgrade, an 'Up' icon appears above it. If you click a tower, you will see a menu which will show: current level, current experience, characteristics (damage, attack range, fire rate), the tower's 'abilities', available upgrades (if there is enough experience). Do not forget to upgrade your towers and look into what new abilities each of the available upgrades gives. This is your way to success because there are particularly strong tower types out there. 2. Special abilities. Three right icons in the level menu. To use abilities, you spend Energy. 1. Hack. This ability has two uses: the first one is hacking something, and the second one is formatting disk space. * Hacking: on many levels, you will see objects surrounded by shields. If you click on such an object, the Hack ability icon will appear above it. If you have enough Energy to use the ability, clicking on this icon will cause one shield to disappear. When an object has no shields covering it, the objects becomes 'Hacked'. From now on, it starts to provide some kind of benefit to the player. * Formatting disk space: every level has areas where you cannot build your towers. This is 'unformatted sick space'. These areas look like a group of chaotically placed cubes of a specific color (Red, Green, Blue). If you use the Hack ability to a tile of this type, the area will be formatted and you will be able to build on it. This might be useful to occupy strategically important points and thus build a more reliable defense. 2. Laser Rain. Allows you to do damage to enemies located in the chosen area. 3. Overclocking. Gives a temporary bonus to attack speeds of all the towers on the level. After every defense attempt (depending on how many waves you have managed to fight off) you get experience and new levels. With each new level, you get 3 patch points. These points can be spent in the patch menu to upgrade your system's defense mechanisms."

With the arrival of the last day of term, Grendel needs to hand in her remaining homework or face the prospect of repeating a year. Drafting in the protagonist to solve her problem, Grendel is annoyed when her demands are swiftly rebuffed. Initiating a devious plan to ensure her education can progress without interruption, Grendel's actions soon attract her mother's attention, who has her own nefarious plans for the protagonist. Features By popular demand, CG graphics have now been introduced to enhance the gameplay. Funny and dramatic SHORT story.

The Fan is my first released game ever =) The game was created using Unity Personal Edition and mostly Lightroom for the pictures. I started the project in 2012 and did all the shootings, which was really fun, but when it came to actually 'make a game', well, it took much more time, effort, tutorials, training and hard work than I expected :D Although The Fan is a pretty short experience (there are no overly twisted puzzles to keep you from going fast if you wanna rush it), it took thousands of pictures and a tremendous amount of work to make it look good enough.

Explore, survive, earn perks, find items and kindness to develop your character and escape to a new life. With hundreds of perks, items, events and more, this serious game comes with a large amount of depth that opens up the more you play, and changes based on how you play. 20% of Delve Interactive's profits from this game will be donated to charities focused on the issue of homelessness. This is a hate letter to the growing indifference in the world. When members of the development team almost fell into homelessness some years ago, it inspired us to create something that gives a voice to the forgotten and the vulnerable. We take the subject very seriously and portray it as such. After over 7 years of research and hard work, 100s of updates and fan support, we bring you our tale of survival and isolation. Choose from 5 different characters each with their own background stories and maladies, then create your own story Find companions and find kindness. Build a reputation or even friendships with various characters including the other homeless and the police Build your inventory with food, survival tools, clothing and more... as well as unlocking new items for your next playthrough as you progress Spend a night in police stations, parks or shelters, spend time at bars, visit the clinic, study in the library, recycle scrap and more as you discover new areas and buildings Learn about the lives of the homeless and everything they go through to survive, with every part of the truth having been heavily researched by the developers Experience a beautifully composed emotional soundtrack Manage your hunger, hygiene, happiness, crime levels, street reputation, study levels and other stats as you try to survive and escape the homeless life. But you can only do so much in one day... what will you do? Will you spend the day begging, depending on the kindness of others? Will you find shelter in the night? Perhaps you're moved out of the area by the police for loitering. Unable to find shelter, you end up on the streets at night, and you meet a dog. Is it a stray? Could it be a friend? All your actions affect your happiness in some way, and it's up to you to manage your stats accordingly. You could turn to drink, but risk addiction. You could hope for a fortunate event, or make some progress towards your survival. But you will have to choose. It could all be over if a bad event occurs in the dangerous night streets. Especially during winter. Every game is different, and with each playthrough comes more ways to explore CHANGE. If you became homeless... what would you do? PLANS Our goal with this project is to raise awareness on the issue of homelessness, as well as raise money for it. We have done a ton of research for this project and while our wish is to portray the reality of homelessness, various aspects of sleeping rough have been abstracted for the sake of gameplay. So far, we've raised over Ã‚Â¶Ã‚Å“7000 for the charities CRISIS, The Clocktower Sanctuary and Shelter. Join us in the community section to discuss the game with the team! We're always listening and awaiting your feedback."

To that, I thank you all! :)) Minds Eyes brings you to a world of dreams. You wake up from your slumber to constantly discover you are still asleep. You venture throughout your own home as well as some pieces of your imagination to discover who or what is keeping you at sleep. Will you ever wake up? will you ever finish the journey? Venture through tense full moments of a chilling and nerve wrecking atmosphere that will keep you wondering 'When will something happen!'. Interact with the game and collect game objects which will overall affect your score in the end. Can you locate all game items?, can you make it without a single death? Check what the mind has in store. NOTE: This game is to be played with a single sitting. The estimated game time is 30-45min. This game also includes flashing lights. If flashing lights affect any of your medical conditions, please avoid the game. **SO! what is Minds Eyes really? think of it as an experiment. I have developed Minds Eyes to experiment with new mechanics, features, animations, interactions, and more. Ultimately, I am using this game to gather information in order to build my ultimate horror experience. Think of it as research and development!. I will be watching a large portion of videos that you all send out to me, and note what was good and bad. With that said, If possible, please give me a full on review of the game.

The idea of Damage is simple: kill as many people as possible! Damage is an adventure game where you can roam freely in a wide urban setting, loot money and goods, buy weapons and other equipment from the black market and kill thousands of enemies: harmless civilians, policemen, army troopers, organised criminals, bloodhounds and vehicles. DSBoH is humoristic and harmless outlet for our violent instincts. THE STORY In Damage you take control of a formerly exemplary man named Michael Modelcitizen, who had everything a man could possibly dream of. Because of that, he soon became deeply frustrated. Michael tried various methods in search of a new super human state, but during the process something went terribly wrong. The solution to regaining his previous status is ugly. Michael starts with a primitive baseball bat, taking out unaware passers-by. It's not long before Michael's actions begins to attract the members of authority - who all try to eliminate him. Of course, he has access to numerous appetising weapons, and he starts experimenting with dangerous drugs to keep himself alive. In Damage, you play as Michael and we guarantee you many, many delightful discoveries and a feeling of extreme freedom to venture and express yourself. LEGACY About Amiga version (1993-1997) The enormous project of making an ideal game of our own started back in 1993. We soon became overly ambitious, and we had no idea of what it took to carry out our plans. But we couldn't give in, just took new challenges to make Damage the best it could be. In 1996 the game was ready and players loved it!"

She was a Franco-Spanish painter and a key figure in the pictorial revival that took place in Europe during the First World War. Her relentless artistic career, her impressive biography as a genius from the time she was a child with physical difficulties, and her extraordinary intelligence made her stand out, especially as a member and only woman of L'Ãƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¸cole de Paris, a star and an essential figure of Cubism. She became one of the most important characters of the 20th century avant-garde art. This virtual gallery is intended to pay tribute to the great artist on the 90th anniversary of her death in Paris, and to introduce her work and language as a painter and theoretician to the interested public. Her new languages and the most advanced techniques are shown in 65 works never seen before.

What the game is about: Honey Rose: UFE tells the story of Red, a young university student with dreams of making it big at the masked fighting tournament . She looks up to Big Blue , the current champion, and aims to meet her idol in the ring ! However, she has a history of poor class attendance , and has repeatedly failed her latest classes. This year, she made a deal with her parents : sheÃ‚Æ’??d either graduate, or theyÃ‚Æ’??d change towns. Unfortunately, the masked fighting tournament also takes place for the first time in the very town Red lives in... making it her one and only chance to make her dream come true! Thankfully, thatÃ‚Æ’??s where you come in ! With your guidance, she needs to balance her studies with her training so she can bring home both the champion's belt, and her graduation. The game is a life-management simulation , presented as a visual novel , with beat'em-up elements . In short: some reading, a little fighting... and lots of planning! Features: A visual novel based around choice and reactivity! See how events unfold based on your decisions... or lack of commitment! A sizeable cast of characters to encounter in dynamic events, with individual subplots to pursue! Fight for your dreams in the ring, or to get back your suit from dastardly thugs in the street! Plan ahead to make the most of the 6 months you have left until graduation! Bring home the champion's belt if you can, but make sure to ace your tests as well! Can you really do both? Pricing The game uses a 'pay-what-you-liked' remuneration model. 'Pay-what-you-liked' is a system designed after 'pay-what-you-want', except you choose to support the game *after* having played it for yourself , and determined its personal value based on your own experience. It is designed to offer each player the most choice possible in how, when and why when considering whether to support the game or not . Since Steam doesn't support 'pay-what-you-liked' or 'pay-what-you-want' remuneration systems, the DLC acts as a stand-in to offer multiple suggested tiers of support . IMPORTANT NOTE : buying DLC stands in for supporting the game at the value of the suggested tier. It will NOT enhance or change your ingame experience, you will not be getting additional content other players can't access , as the aim for this system is for the game to be the same for everyone: ie, its most complete state right off the bat! That also means the game is NOT F2P/P2W: there is NO in-game economy that allows you to pay for additional content. The game is fully available for free from the minute you start playing it!"

Realistic weather effects, rolling hills, and animated scenery all add to game's visual perfection. Xpand Rally also features highly detailed models of modern rally cars and handling physics developed with the help of rally sport professionals which further enhance the realism of driving experience. Xpand Rally combines the best elements of Rally and Rally Cross racing in one unique gaming experience. The game offers a career mode based on time trials during both individual races and World Championship Series which will satisfy traditional Rally fans. The Rally Cross fans won't be disappointed either - they can challenge several opponents in head to head racing during competitions based on real and fictitious race events. Xpand Rally, as the only title on the market, brings the economy factor into a rally game. The player starts with a junk car and competes in races to earn money and acquire upgrades, repair damage, tweak performance and pay the race entry fees. Along with the tuning-up, the car's condition affects its handling. Due to accurate damage system, it is highly dependent on the player's driving skills. The physical handling model is also influenced by car parts configuration and provides both authentic feel and joy of driving. The interactive race track surroundings with enhanced game physics and the innovative approach to changing daytime and weather conditions, both influencing the car handling, are other hallmarks of Xpand Rally that distinguish it from other racing games. For the first time among rally games Xpand Rally includes a complete set of easy-to-use editing tools enabling to create new tracks, cars or even game mods."

Play as Aella, a spunky Falkonir, or Horu, the brave Falcon, as you work together to explore a mountain devastated by wild magic and plagued by nightmarish wraiths to put an end to the corruption. On the continent of Myrelin lies a village to the Northwest known as Frostfall. It is here the kingdom, Kingstone, trains the most elite scout units Myrelin has ever seen, the Falkonirs. It is the Falkonir's sworn duty to watch over the lands to protect the kingdom from any encroaching armies or outbursts of wild magic and monsters. On a day like any ordinary, Aella begins training with her falcon, Horu, and her mentor. When suddenly the ground trembles and shakes, and a thunderous crack pierces through the air revealing that Mount Bohlgast has unleashed its stored nightmares. Wraiths begin to manifest and envelop everything in their surroundings. With Aella barely saved by Horu's newfound strength, it is up to the two of them to end whatever wild magic is plaguing their people."

The parameterization allows not only an easy model editing, but also parts family creation that is an important issue in automating creation of variant models with the same constructive basis, such as fasteners, automotive, hydraulic and civil components. From a parametric part you can automatically generate dozens of others parts through parameters association, such as thickness, length, number and diameter of holes, color, material, information, text, etc. Assembly module Easy, accurate and effective, this module enables you to build assemblies using modeled parts and sub-assemblies. The automatic link between the modules facilitates the manipulation of assembly parts, thus any editing on a part or assembly, results in an automatic change in the assembly that references this component. You can build assemblies by inserting components created outside the assembly document"

Unlikely saviors joined by fate and duty. A mission driven by music, magic...and survival. Murasaki is a hybrid shmup and puzzle game that creates intense and high-speed gameplay against a serene landscape with gorgeous music. With the ability to only fire a single bullet at a time, you must use cunning, angles and timing to survive. Random shapes will appear as the levels progress: these designs will trigger massive explosions when shot. If you can bounce corresponding shapes off of each other, they'll create a chain reaction that, with a little luck, will wipe the screen. Don't wait too long, because the enemies will overwhelm you in a second! If you can't get a clear shot, each character has a special attack with limited uses. Use them wisely to get out of a tight situation or to put the finishing blow on one of several bosses! Characters Kairi The older of the heroes, Kairi acts as a big brother, though he's not related to Satsuki. His movements are slow, but his long range shot can reach anywhere on the screen, perfect for ricochet combinations. This however, also means that you don't have rapid shots. Kairi's special attack is a spiraling explosion that reaches most of the screen. This bomb can absorb enemy's bullets and destroy multiple targets. Use it wisely. Satsuki The younger hero, Satsuki is impetuous and headstrong, and it shows in her attack formation. Satsuki can move across the screen quickly, but the range of her shots is very short. Sometimes they won't reach the enemy. However, using her speedy shots, you can bounce the explosive blocks farther than Kairi, which makes it easier to create a chain attack with other blocks. Just be careful not to bounce them too far, or the explosion won't reach the enemy! Her special attack is a cross-formation energy wave. It hits harder than Kairi's, but could easily miss if the timing is off. Use it wisely. Find your center and get into a flowing rhythm of evading and exploding. If you can master the mechanics, Murasaki is insanely satisfying, mixing the mayhem and the tranquil music in a beautiful dissonant clash. Failure means death, swift and painful. Don't look at where the bullets in front of you go: plan for where the explosions will happen afterwards. There is a long and tragic story within Murasaki: each successful (and even unsuccessful) chapter unlocks new information, history, bios and even musical tracks. To truly understand the full game, you must become an expert with both Kairi AND Satsuki. It's daunting, it's hard, but the satisfaction of a full unlock is unmatched. Config You can start a config tool from 'Launch Configuration Tool' when you start the game. Here, you can configure the screen size, BGM/SE ratio, key bindings, etc. The death of an empire. The rise of darkness. And two heroes alone combat a broken soul."

As soon as the military got informed of such qualities of zombie-genome, they immediately started to develop a new kind of biological weapon. After many experiments they finally made the first prototype of a biological weapon which had its own mind and shapeless jelly-like body. It had an ability to take control of any living creature. This weapon gave them an opportunityto resolve any conflict by force. But one day there was an emergency. One of the labs in Colony No4 went out of power just for a few seconds.

Many creatures have gained sentience in this timeline leading to the rise of frogman, catsons, owlpeople and many other races. Over time humans have developed psychic abilities that they can invoke with the use of mechanical psychic actuators, these psychic abilities allow them to summon fire or teleport to new locations among many other powers. The destruction of this world was caused by Dark Gods of sacrifice known as the Gods of Destruction, the player can sacrifice items to these entities in order to receive powerful boons from them. The apocalypse was thousands of years in the past and many of those living today have very little to no knowledge of the events that transpired or the fact that there even was an apocalypse. Design Goals Our goal is to create a MMO experience that rings true to how classic tabletop Dungeons and Dragons feels with weekly meetups where the dungeon master is creating new custom content for his players taking their decisions and desires into account. We want to have a very active community and will be working very hard to interact directly with the players of the game. We also want to implement new concepts like temporary bosses that drop limited edition items. Controls Left Click to perform the most obvious action on a given tile. Right click to bring out a drop-down menu of all possible actions for a given tile. Tab to show or hide the sidebar. FAQ Here is a little set of common questions about the game in a FAQ format. We thought this would be an easy way to get across a lot of information. How do you guys make money? We sell bonds which grant membership. The bonds are redeemable for 14 days of membership and can be traded with other players if you so desire. This means its feasible to do an in game activity for someone who has already bought a bond and trade them for the bond as payment for the activity as a means to become a member. What is membership? Membership is the full game experience and unlocks access to all of the in game skills and grants access to the entire game world. Money made from membership helps us cover the server costs and really helps us out! Will you ever sell experience or items directly? No we will not. The only thing we will sell are bonds. The value of a bond in game is determined by the players and what they are willing to trade for them. The only way to gain experience or items will be to play the game. We don't believe in selling power. What are your goals in terms of membership? Our biggest goal would be to get 500 monthly members which would allow us to cover all our server costs and both work on the game full time. Any members over this amount would be an absolute blessing! What happens when I die in game? All of your currently equipped and all items in your inventory will be dropped and you will re-spawn in Split City. Will you reimburse my items if I die and lose a lot of them? No we will not, dying in game and losing items is part of the game and it's up to you to bank important items you don't wish to lose. How many towns are there in game? There are 14 towns currently in the game. What happens if I forget my password? As long as you provided your email address when creating your account we can reset your password for you. At a later stage we will facilitate linking your Steam account to your Damascus account which will provide extra security and password retrieval mechanisms. Why aren't you guys doing Early Access? The way we view MMORPG's is that they are inherently a service. Our goal is to constantly update the game as long as it is live. Due to this we didn't want to be yet another permanently in early access game and have decided to have the first stable version of the game be our release version with many updates and future content already in the pipeline. How often will you update the game? We plan to update the game every couple of weeks with new content, however this is a loose timeline and it could be shorter or longer depending on the content we are currently working on. We intend to be very active on Discord so you can always ask us directly about what we are working on and approximately when you can expect the next update. Will you ever expand the world map? Yes we do plan to at some stage release new Islands and Continents which will expand the scope and scale of the game. However these updates will take some time to implement and most likely come with new quests as some of our larger updates to the game. Will I get banned for selling in game items for cash to my friends? No you won't. All in game items earned by you belong to you and you a responsible for them, this means you are free to give them away or sell them to other people and it also means that it's your responsibility to not lose your items in silly ways (like attacking a Damascus Steel Dragon at a low level). Will I get banned for using/creating a third party client? We won't be supporting third party clients and we would consider this a bannable offense. The only version of the client one should use is the Steam version. Will I get banned for macroing or botting? Macros that make the game easier as well as botting are not in the spirit of the game and are considered a bannable offense. We suggest avoiding macroing entirely."

Animations and particle effects, tokens, and audio files can be used to immerse your players. It's a player, not a 3d map-building software. Both the demo and the full version contain only a few simple battle grids, so you will need the videos or static battle maps of Dynamic Dungeons or other creators. This software is in constant development, future updates will be free. Import Dynamic Dungeons maps or your own images or video files into the storyline and make a playlist, cover and reveal areas with the fog of war tool, apply custom size hex or quad grid overlay. Playing on the Tv screen is easier than you think. Simply lay flat your TV. You can protect the screen with a cheap plexiglass sheet, and use dry or wet-erase markers on it, so miniatures and dice rolls won't damage the surface of the Tv. You can also project down the video onto a physical table with an HD projector. Please note, that it's not a VTT for online gaming. The Dynamic Dungeons Editor will help you to adjust the color of the videos and static maps, import png tokens to represent the players and their foes. You can play various ambient sounds and use particle effects to pimp up static or animated maps. A free modular dungeon pack is available for this software containing more than 100 png props like corridors and various chambers to build your own dungeon. (Although there are many customization options available and custom 2D maps can be created with the application, be aware that Dynamic Dungeons maps are not made with this app, but in various 3D software. You may want to try the demo version before you buy.)"

Texas Holdem Poker: Solo King,2020-03-04,0.0,12.99,nan,,,,nan,nan,"The game consists of two parts: 1: In the console game section, you can play tournament games and heads-up games against professional-level AI opponents. 2: A complete set of Texas Hold'em calculation tools The table below shows the functional price comparison between the computing tools in the game and other Texas-related computing products on the market. Help players solve two problems: 1: Have a complete tool chain: You have purchased a complete set of Texas Hold'em calculation-related tools at a very cheap price, and it calculates correctly and runs stably. It is cheap, comprehensive, and convenient. One account can share data on multiple platforms, and the functions are consistent, and there is no castration. 2: Learn the playing strategies of professional poker players: You only play games with professional-level AI and learn the playing strategies of professional poker players. There is no random behavior to confuse you with entertaining AI, and I don't want to waste your time. Satisfy player pursuit and advancement: 1: When players play Texas Hold'em, they just want to find and master a set of playing strategies that suit their profession. The professional AI I wrote is written in accordance with the standard textbook-style playing strategies of professional poker players, and they are all in standard poker scenarios. fixed action paradigm, It is very fixed, not random, which helps you quickly understand the playing strategies of professional players. to learn this strategy. Your discovery and learning of patterns will not be interfered with by random strategies. Don't think it's going to be silly, it plays a lot better than most players in online real money games. You can buy it on steam to try its AI capabilities, if you are not satisfied, you will get an unconditional refund within 2 hours, you have nothing to lose at all. This AI uses standard and mature textbook play to fight against you. You can learn the AI's play, understand the AI's play, and find your own way of defeating the AI. It all depends on your own understanding and ability. The AI Ã‚Æ’??Ã‚Æ’??is not responsible for providing you with the thrill of victory, it is up to you to win. The more games you play in the world of online real money gaming, the more severely you feel you are bound, you feel right, you are almost all playing with a group of professional players who rely on a full suite of scientific tools to give real-time calculations and decision-making cues playing. It was people who were heavily armed like me. In fact, the AI Ã‚Æ’??Ã‚Æ’??strategy in this game basically covers all my action strategy logic. I wrote it to greatly reduce the energy consumption of my decision-making in the poker game. The strategies in this game are extremely effective at PokerStars blind levels below $10/$20. Further up, I don't want to play games with too much stake, so I can't stand up effectively, so I don't level up. 2): You have learned strategies, and you need a complete set of tools to assist you. Without scientific calculation tools, in real money poker games, you have strategies and dare not use them. The essence of Texas Hold'em is a real mathematical probability game. Data and calculations determine the choice of strategies. In the past two years, the Texas Hold'em books handwritten by foreign professional players who have been translated by the player groups on Taobao are very expensive, far more expensive than my game. Those books cost hundreds of yuan, and they are still very popular. This marks that although the state strictly prohibits Texas games, players' pursuit of strategic knowledge has not stopped. They provided some foreign poker experience and strategies, and I provided a professional training ground and toolset that also filled the gaps for the Chinese in terms of Texas science tools. 3): Optics does not practice, it is natural to learn, and it is valuable to apply what you have learned. You donÃ‚Æ’??t know whether you are cheating or not, and you donÃ‚Æ’??t know why you win or lose. Basically, you are just playing for nothing. In this game, you can freely organize the table, freely set the blind level, freely set the hand range of each opponent, freely set the opponent's AI type, and freely set your own hand range, so that every time the card is dealt, the You're dealt hands in this range, and you're also free to set one of the 20 good hands, so there's a definite training. In the game, the various win rate data, listening win rate, and EV data of each player on each street are calculated in real time, saving you the trouble of manual calculation, and also giving you AI decision-making suggestions from professional-level textbooks. These ensure that you can train fully on demand. and judging whether it makes sense for you. The complete display of this information in the game also helps you analyze the game, so that you know the logic of your winning and losing, where you win and where you lose. Don't think that you lost, it was me who cheated, you can understand whether I cheated by reading the data and graphs carefully, you can't understand these, either you have no knowledge of technology and playing cards, or your understanding is too poor, what? It's all clear, you still can't understand it, and it's clear that you don't have the ability to think, and you can't play IQ games, so don't waste time torturing yourself. Tell you clearly: 1: I sell strategies and tools, and I show you professional strategies in the game. 2: The game is sold at a fixed price. Even if you lose all the chips and diamonds, the server will continue to supply chips and diamonds for you to play. There will be no extra charge. I don't need to cheat you for chips and diamonds at all. , I don't even bother with it. 3: The chips and diamonds provided are enough for you to play 50000 hands. You need about 500 hours to play them all. For the vast majority of players, they will not spend 500 hours on a certain game. They do not give you a huge amount. The chips and diamonds are also to bring you closer to the real world to play from small stacks, so that it makes sense. 4: It is not a multiplayer online crowd gambling game, but a console game, or more precisely, a training tool. The networking function ensures that you can freely share usage data between your mobile phone and computer. This game is more precisely a training tool and a tool for assisting actual combat calculation and strategy. I have provided you with a trainer aircraft and a fighter jet, and it is up to you to combine your wisdom, ability and financial resources to control and use it to assist you. If you think you want to train yourself and experience the brutality of professional gambling, then you can play hard. It provides you with the basic prerequisite knowledge, skill-strategy mix, training environment and toolsets you need from beginner to pro. As a poker tool, the existing functions have completely covered the calculation and decision-making functions of the whole process and all stages required for scientific training and real-time battles. At least it's completely enough for me. There is no longer any free on mobile: 1: Before the V4 version, a free google play version was provided for the convenience of steam players to download the mobile version for free, and for some users who were unwilling to pay to experience the function for free. The new version of V4 will be forced to upgrade from the beginning, and the old mobile phone version will not be able to log in. Old users who pay for it need to ask me for it. 2: Now I don't offer any free versions on all platforms. Now the computer and mobile phones have the same functions, and the google play also has the same price on steam. But you only need to buy the steam version, then you can send me a letter to ask for the corresponding android mobile version. When asking for the android version, you need to provide a screenshot of your purchase history on the steam platform to prove it. Just send me a screenshot of the purchase record information in the email. 3: All versions are unified as paid versions, and the price is the same, which ensures the rights and interests of paying players and the quality level of players. 4: On February 26, 2022, the new version of the server was updated to Alibaba Cloud, with 4 cores of 8G, 10M dedicated bandwidth, 80G cloud disk, and a 3-year lease, so the service for at least the next three years is guaranteed. If you are a streamer and have some fans, you are willing to play it, and willing to share and show this game to your fans, I am willing to provide you with some steam keys. Send me a letter with your platform and number of followers hits: In the battle mode, the range of each player is also shown to you graphically, and the player's hole cards are in the corresponding range. In the pc version, you can select a large resolution in the setting function, so that you can see the range map well in the game. And the most important thing is that it's the cheapest of its kind. manualÃ‚â€¹Ã‚Â¬? We welcome capable agent wholesalers from all over the world to sell the software, I provide retail steam keys in all regions of the world 100~500 steam keys, 30% off 500~1000 steam keys, 40% off 1000~2000 steam keys, 50% off The larger the wholesale quantity, the better the discount {LINK REMOVED} core function: 1: Click the function board card to set the community card, and click the hole card icon to set the hole card. 2: Different player types can be set, and each player has a different range of actions. These ranges also determine different action logics. 3: Equity calculator, draw equity calculator, EV calculator, real-time poker simulator tool. 4: Real-time poker simulator tool, this is the most important for online professional players, which greatly simplifies the time consumption of thinking and performing calculations. 5: Advisor (advisor) provides you with a standard play, the basic guarantee is not to lose money. 6: Before the action decision, provide the EV value of different actions and betsize. 7: Practice the advisor and action EV in the battle mode. Core value points: 1: Poker simulator tool: When playing poker online, professional players can display the complete mathematical data immediately after entering the opponent's range in real time according to the situation of the game table, saving users calculation time and energy, and providing standardized behavior suggestions. These real-time and accurate calculation data and standardized action suggestions help players make quick decisions. Value point: It saves the player's energy consumption in mathematical calculations in the game, and allows the player to invest more energy to focus on the accurate determination of the player's playing range and the use of real-time data to make decisions based on experience. Real-time display of all poker game data, which is not available in other tools. I combined the various data calculation functions scattered in multiple Texas poker calculation software into the real game. The player only needs to determine the opponent's range. In the simulator, Preflop and postflop are also purchased professional range action data, which can be set in the simulator: stacks deep, bet size, and player position to see the real-time advisor. Now this advisor is conservative. range data comes from rangeconverter.com/solution_formats/eight_max-MTT-Complete-Postflop-Addon-NEWOnlineViewer-yearly The core of the simulator is that you need to have the ability to judge the opponent's range of action. This is also one of the most basic and most important abilities of playing cards. If you donÃ‚Æ’??t have the ability to display the range of Texas Hold'em at all, then you can use this tool to repeatedly play poker to familiarize yourself with the range. In the battle mode I provide the ability to display the range in real time. Let you clearly see how different people in different ranges play, and those actions are standard textbook play styles for professional players. Real-time display of complete data: The data standard provided comes from the result of 10,000 times Equity calculated by Monte Carlo method. In the battle mode with AI, you need to turn on the observer mode switch (observer) Data in the avatar frame: 1): EV: 0.70BB, indicating the EV data after the current operation. BB stands for the big blind value. 2): equity data for each street: 2r: 4"

It features challenging real-time tactical combat, a wide variety of spells, and a dark and brooding dungeon full of lethal enemies, sadistic traps, and mind-bending puzzles. The world of Uuld is under siege by the Vampyr who have destroyed and devoured all but a few remaining strongholds of civilization. The world's last hope, Shade, an ancient and legendary vampire hunter, has been bitten in the last epic battle on the surface. You play as Shade now struggling against the vampiric curse, using it to heal yourself but at a terrible price. You must fight your way through a twisted labyrinth of horror and death to finally face the Pale King, lord of all Vampires, before succumbing to the vampiric curse yourself. Fools Rush In This is a game that will challenge you to think tactically about every situation. Rushing into a room without a good plan will most likely get you killed very quickly. Control the flow of combat by using spells and potions to slow, stun, confuse, poison, scatter, separate and take out your enemies a few at a time. The Thirst As a half-vampire your primary means of healing is drinking the blood of your fallen enemies. Using this ability pushes you closer and closer to full vampire. Use it sparingly or pay the price. There are ways to reduce your build-up of evil, such as potions and holy altars, but they are few and your enemies are many. Items are Everything With the exception of your basic melee attack, every spell and ability you will have is based on the items you choose to equip to the 6 slots in your action bar. As you progress through the game and your pack begins to fill with dozens of items, choosing what you equip to your action slots will define everything about how you play and what you can do. Secrets Within Secrets Few will find every secret or unlock every puzzle in this centuries old dungeon. Evil has been at work here since ancient antiquity and there is more concealed in this place of eternal gloom than anywhere else in Uuld. Decisions that Will Shape the Cosmos There are many factions at play here and who you decide to ally with and who you decide to oppose has the power to dramatically reshape your story and the fate of this world, and possibly many others."

The Earth has been overrun. A mutating, alien menace threatens the last remnants of mankind. Only the Phoenix Project, a secret organization of the best minds and bravest soldiers left on earth, can repel the invasion and reverse the inevitable. The Phoenix Project looks to you for leadership. Research and develop new technologies, explore a ravaged globe, build your bases, manage resources, and dominate the battlefield. Just remember: you're not alone out there. Factions, including the corporatist New Jericho, the indecisive Synedrion, and the fanatical Disciples of Anu, as well as a variety of offshoot subfactions, have their own values, goals, and view of the Pandorans. Work with these factions via Phoenix Point's diplomacy system, use subterfuge to steal what you need from them, or simply crush all around you with military might. No matter what you choose, victory won't be easy. Phoenix Point Features: Tons of Content: Over two years of updates, upgrades, fixes, and new content suggested by our community, including Steam Workshop support for subscribing and enabling mods, tweaking existing mods, and setting up your game the way you want to play. Try our example 'Custom Camapign' mod to set up new unique campaigns. Mutating Alien Menace: Face down an ever-changing alien threat that adapts to your tactics and offers no respite even as your team becomes more powerful and technologically advanced. Uncover the Secrets of the Pandoravirus: Engage with a complex narrative, complete with multiple endings that the player can only uncover via several playthroughs. Explore, research, and discover a secret history, as you learn about the origins of the mutants, the Pandoravirus, and Phoenix Point itself. Manage Diplomatic Relations: The Phoenix Project is not the only organization trying to reclaim the Earth. The militaristic New Jericho, the mystical Disciples of Anu, and the technophiles of Synedrion all offer unique rewards for co-operation and threats for opposition. It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them. Take Aim on the Battlefield: In addition to equipping and commanding units, Phoenix Point lets you take direct control of your soldier's shots in combat, with a unique free-aiming system. Target enemy weakspots, weapons, or valuables, or just go for center mass. Next-Gen Tech with Classic Pedigree: Phoenix Point was designed by Julian Gollop, the creator of the X-COM series in the 1990s. Integrating the core ethos of X-COM while updating the visuals, technology, and systems to modern standards has made Phoenix Point best-in-class."

You play as a small fox a fairytale story with Kings, Queens, and witches. This game is a text-based adventure created with the intention of allowing the user to experience the frustration of being dyslexic. Sentences and words are made intentionally hard to read through different rules of how they are constructed change with every chapter, ranging from a flickering background, jittery letters and PQBS's being swapped around. Choices must be made in a quick time which leads to even more frustration. Much like a book, you could skip to the end of this game thought the chapter select menu but this is supposed to simulate the fact that you can do this but don't get any satisfaction from doing so. You can re-read chapters to see if you can get a better outcome. There are a bunch of options to try to make the game easier to play based on people's common conceptions on what fixes dyslexia. There is an option to add a colored overlay and remove the flicker in an attempt to combat 'Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome/ Irlen Syndrome'. And there is an option to change the font to Open Dyslexic which in my opinion is harder to read. There are options which allow you to play the game in non-dyslexic mode if you want, but wheres the fun in that. The game includes a range of accessibility settings.

You have to jump on platforms and use certain fruit such as the apple which gives you a higher jump height to reach certain platforms or the banana fruit which gives you movement speed so you can jump further or run away from the magician. The core of the gameplay relies on the fruit and the ability to use them in a unique way. You can throw fruit at enemies to stun them as well as collide with them to destroy them. If youÃ‚Æ’??re not the same color as the enemy youÃ‚Æ’??ll take damage but if you are the same color youÃ‚Æ’??ll destroy the enemy without taking damage.

We got so used to it that news from Syria has become trivial. We've even already forgotten how it all started, and where the roots of the terrible terror lie Ã‚Æ’?? the terror that swept across Europe in recent years. Syria is all over the news, and it's become a subject of many documentaries. We, however, want to show the story through the lens of the game and don't let the word 'game' mislead you. This game does not claim to be a history lesson, but it shows the course of the war in all its seriousness through the major milestones, from the first days till the latest important victories over terror. What kind of a game is it? Syrian Warfare is a real time strategy with a high degree of realism. This game is not about a base construction or units production. The player will have to determine their forces characteristics before they go into action. And during the mission, they would be able to select reinforcements in order to support the troopers. The troops and machinery crews move from mission to mission and gain experience, which helps them increase their effectiveness. Trophies captured by the player on the battlefield can be used throughout the whole campaign. Importantly enough, there are no Ã‚Â¶Ã‚Â®life barsÃ‚Â¶Ã‚Â¯ for vehicles in the game. Damages are calculated by taking into account the protection module and the power of adverse factors. Inflicted damages affect the functioning of the module. In the battlefield, it is impossible to repair the armor, but one can repair the modules by using a limited stock of spare parts. Ammunition and fuel are also limited. A system of high-quality physical demolition of buildings and other objects is used in the game (it does not only look spectacular, but it has a serious influence on the tactics during the missions, especially in urban areas). The game has a wide set of tactical possibilities: The storming of buildings, usage of smokescreens, infantry lift by helicopters and APC/IFV, air strike calls, capturing of trophy weapons and equipment, usage of heat flares and active defense complexes. And of course the story itself. We will try to show the conflict, not from a point of view of a general, located somewhere at the Ã‚Æ’??topÃ‚Æ’??. No, it will be a story of a man, who lived in the country that descended into hell. A story of struggle, loss and regained hope."

You can never beat endless mode, but you can rack up a nice highscore by lighting up blocks in your frantic escape from an inevitable death! The Level Editor Yes, you read that correctly! You could be the proud owner of a fully functional level editor to create your own masterpiecel. Save and load levels for later! Not only that, but you can even copy the level-code to your clipboard and paste it somewhere for your friends to copy and paste into their own editor. No file transfers necessary! Visuals PRiO was meant to be a visually pleasing experience. While the gameplay itself is challenging, your eyes will have a wonderful time letting in all the beautiful lighting effects and particles. Soundtrack The absolutely gorgeous soundtrack for this game was created by Erik Danielson at Color-Blind Friendly Because PRiO is about the three primary colors, it comes with a color-blind option for those who need it. PRiO is currently only available on Windows. Please note: The game is completely functional using a keyboard and mouse, however it's highly recommended that you use a Gamepad to play PRiO."

The game is divided in 2 main interfaces : a worldmap view and a regional view. Each world tile matches a unique procedurally generated isometric zone that can be explored, settled and built on by players. In each one players can find random resources such as ores , animals or plants depending on the climate, relief and vegetation of the region. Features Pigs with clothes. Multiplayer on local or persistent servers. Complex socio-economic simulator for a challenging city-building experience on its own. Technological evolution with hundreds to techs, from the stone age to post-iron age. Fully procedural worlds where each region is random and unique. 7 biomes, each one with its own specific resources to encourage player-trading. Advanced diplomatic and economic tools to setup treaties ( right of passage, taxes, payments, trade agreements... ) and trade routes between players. Real-time battles. WILL remain free of any pay-to-win . Economy No direct control over population and economy: They breed, age, work and buy things according to the simulation. Population divided in social classes with specific incomes, purchasing power and revenues. Dynamic resources prices based on supply/demand, rarity and production costs. Even player consumed resources are taken into account: materials for buildings have to be bough at their market prices, generating incomes to the producers and affecting the economy. A simulator instead of a set of independent game rules : all variables and actions influence each other in sometimes unpredictable ways that makes things frustratingly challenging. Producing too much of something can be as damaging as not enough making the logic of the game quite different from classic management games. ( ex: instead of having positive effects, distributing a new resource can actually destabilize your economy if you're not careful ) Military Real-time battles are not instantiated and actually take place in your cities. Build and customize your fortifications with walls, bridges, gates, stairs, towers and battlements. With the terrain tools, modify the terrain heights to take maximum advantage of natural defenses like cliffs and hill tops. Water forces troops to embark and cross with slow vulnerable rafts: dig canals around your forts, secure your bridges or build a citadel on a river-island with fortified bridges. A Strategic-tool allows players to design their local defensive strategy in each one of their cities in case of attack: creating defensive zones, setting troops initial deployment positions and setting their behavior in battle. Battles are not instantaneous and belligerents can send reinforcements while a battle is still in progress. Battles can include unlimited 'teams' at the same time, each one fighting according to its allegiances. Battle troops during a battle are all AI controlled ( so that battles can happen independently of the player's presence ). Dozens of unit types including mounted camels, elephants and armored mammoths. Main game modes Real-time mode : a 'classical' mode to be played alone or with a few friends, meant to be played with the permanent presence of all players and to be stopped/continued over several playing sessions. Persistent mode : a more 'MMO' mode where the game server is to be left running 24/7 at all times even when players are offline and where actions take much more time than in the real-time mode. Meant to be played with the maximum number of players on a day-to-day basis, with games lasting several weeks. IMPORTANT This game is a one-man project: development is slow. This game is likely to forever remain an experimental work-in-progress and to never reach the quality, stability and optimization of a finished product: buy it only if you think it's worth it NOW, and not based on future expectations. Playing solo is possible, but the main focus of this game is multiplayer. The game is available in more languages than English, but localization is done by the community and might be partial and incomplete."

'Win by Definition' is a one-player card game adventure. The card games you've been playing are probably that you have to try to reduce the opponent's HP/LP or collect some points to win. Sometimes you may be a bit tired of bogus rules and incomprehensible effect processing. But this game is quite different. Run the card which has the effect 'win' below, or that's all. you will be born as a role of a subspace in a world where nothing should have existed and explore for what you are. The goal [/] In a card game, you do everything that is written on the card. Draw cards, send them to the graveyard area, exile things ... that's not all. You even need a card to enter some stages and move around the world. Sometimes you will get and own cards, for battle others. Define the victory, and challenge every way for the victory. Features [/] Unquestionable gameplay [/] It's very difficult to explain how this game works. If I say 'You use one card. Repeat this.', It may be an explanation of the rules. The most remarkable feature of this game is its simplicity. What to draw each turn, how many cards to draw, where you draw from, even where is the hand, how can you win for, are there opponents, and what are your live points, even is there a status of 'life point' ? Everything is undefined until a stage starts. Example of Card effects [/] Here are just a sort of 5% of the effects used in the game.

X-Plane 10 Global - 64 Bit,2014-07-14,0.0,0.0,nan,,,,nan,nan,"X-Plane 10 Global is the latest version of a simulator that has been in development continuously for almost 20 years. This latest version of X-Plane 10 brings numerous improvements and enhancements for PC, Mac and Linux virtual pilots, unleashing the power of modern systems with its 64 bit processing and multi-core support. Designed to be the most flexible flight simulator it has a fully open structure that allows the enthusiast to change every part. With thousands of compatible add-ons there is no kind of flying craft that is not simulated and there is a whole world to explore. Boasting a 20 year old pedigree, X-Plane utilizes Incredible cloudscapes to bring the sky to life whilst the ground depicts real-world roads, cities, towns and more to ensure the most realistic flying experience possible. The completely new rendering engine shows the world around you in high detail and with global illumination so lights behave like real lights. The core is a virtual wind tunnel that creates the most realistic flight modeling available on a desktop. Equally capable of simulating every type of aircraft, the virtual pilot is able to experience the challenges of flying big airliners or tiny ultra-light aircraft. The realism of X-Plane 10 Global is proven by the fact that X-Plane is used as a certified training tool. Each aircraft flies just as it should, from the glider to the Space Shuttle! Air Traffic Control will guide you from startup to shut-down and also controls the other aircraft around you. Those other aircraft are not robotic as they are in other simulators, but they interact with the world in the same way as your own aircraft does. They will fight the same cross winds and turbulence as you encounter, they will need more runway to stop when the weather conditions are not favorable. Just like real pilots do, you will watch their take-off to be prepared for what your take-off will be like. ItÃ‚Æ’??s still simulated but it gets very close to real aviation! X-Plane 10 Global is built with the future in mind and makes full use of the hardware in your system. If you own a fast multi-core machine you will be able to simulate more aircraft around you and see more details but even with a moderate machine X-Plane 10 Global is capable of displaying a tremendous amount of objects without slowing down.

One strategy won't be able to defeat them all. You'll need to learn, adapt then conquer. Developer Note: This is my first game on Steam and I did this by myself.

Introduction: Gem tower defense is different from general tower defense games. The map of gem tower defense is extremely open and free. Players need to constantly plan and build labyrinths to delay the advance of waves of monsters hitting the fortress. Well-planned firepower is also essential. Rely on the powerful attack ability of different gem combinations to destroy the monsters who 'please enter the urn' and successfully defend your fortress. 2. Basic gameplay operation: Challenge several waves of invaders, with increasing blood volume and increasing difficulty. 1. Place 5 random gems in each wave, choose one of them to stay after the placement is over, the other gems will be turned into stones, which can be used as a maze. 2. If 2 of the 5 gems placed are the same, you can upgrade a gem with a higher level, and if there are 4 identical gems, you can upgrade a gem with a higher level of 2. 3. If any of the 5 gems placed this time directly meet the special synthesis, click any of the gems to perform the special synthesis. 4. After the placement is over, if there are gems on the map that meet the special synthesis requirements, click any of the gems to perform special synthesis. 5. After the placement is over, select the reserved gems to perform downgrade operations to facilitate the synthesis of special gems. 6. Press the space bar to quickly place and retain. Third, the type attribute of the tower: 1. Basic tower: It is the tower that can appear in each round, divided into eight types and six levels 2. Synthesis tower: a tower that can only be synthesized by formula 3. Stone slabs: Towers that can only be synthesized through recipes (can only be placed and synthesized this time) 4. Star tower: obtained by super-synthesis of the same gems after reservation (the highest three-star, cannot participate in the synthesis) 5.

This game showcases the revolutionary Freedom Locomotion System that provides you with a wide range of options, which will allow you to find the most immersive fit regardless of how motion sickness sensitive you might be. The Freedom Locomotion System puts CAOTS (Controller Assisted On The Spot) at the front and center of the system. This is a form of walking in place locomotion solution where to move, you simply walk, jog or run on the spot, allowing you to walk, jog or run in VR. This also has the benefit of allowing you to traverse large open world VR spaces in an immersive manner while been less likely to get motion sick than traditional sliding VR locomotion solutions. For those that prefer a less active solution, or are still susceptible to motion sickness even while walking on the spot, the system provides Dash and Blink steps that are derived from teleportation schemes that have been proven effective in not causing motion sickness. Any way you choose, you'll find that you can get around the various large scale environments in an immersive manner that helps you feel as though you were really there. The primary goal of Freedom Locomotion VR is to provide a proof of concept demo to show that VR is very capable of taking advantage of immersive large scale environments along with many of the game play norms that we've become accustomed to in traditional games."

Kinetic Void,2014-11-21,0.0,19.99,nan,,,,nan,nan,"About Kinetic Void Kinetic Void is a 3D space adventure with a focus on customization and exploration. The shipyard allows players to construct their ship piece by piece. Ships can be as simplistic as a cockpit, a hull, a engine and a gun, or as complex as a player wants. Each module has available subsystems which can be applied to strengthen specific attributes of the ship, and when damaged, those subsystems may be destroyed. While in space flight, interactions between objects are governed by the physics engine. Running into an asteroid at high speed will damage your ship, potentially with catastrophic effects. Using the Kinetic Field Generator (KFG) in game will allow your ship to create an artificial gravity around the ship, both protecting the ship as well as allowing your ship to fly freely through space. This field will also enable the Micro Warp Drive, catapulting your ship far into space in a matter of seconds. Kinetic Void is a procedurally generated adventure, there is no main story line. The decisions and direction is left up to the player. Ally with factions, go to war, build your ship and amass wealth, the choices are yours. A New Galaxy Every Time. Procedural galaxy creation allows as many new experiences as you'd like. When a new game is started, the galaxy map, contents of each sector, and the factions involved will be generated from scratch. You may continue to play this galaxy, or if you'd like to try something different, create a brand new galaxy. Don't worry, your old galaxy will be saved in its current state if you ever wish to return. Choose how many sectors you'd like in your galaxy, as well as how many factions (NPCs) and whether your ships will be Creative or Career mode. Know Your Neighbors. In Kinetic Void the galaxy is a living, breathing thing. Not all factions get along, not all of them hate each other. As factions interact, agreements and treaties will be made and broken. Trade, combat and piracy will affect how the factions see each other based on their own internal standings. Fully Detailed and customizable Space Ships. Tailor your ship for any role. Make a sleek fighter, a bulky freighter, or a mighty carrier. Your shipÃ‚Æ’??s capabilities and appearance are completely up to you. Using Kinetic VoidÃ‚Æ’??s ship builder you can make exactly the ship you want. Customize every part of your ship from cockpits, hulls, engines, weapons, and aesthetic modules. Each module has its own statistics that affect the total performance of your ship. Every module can be further customized by adding subsystems (right click on a module to add subsystems). You can even color your ship exactly how you want. Each module has seven color fields allowing you to make amazing ships quickly, and easily. Once your ship is created, save it to your computer, or share it to the Steam Workshop for the world to see. Subscribed ships from the workshop have a random chance of making it into any new galaxy as a faction vessel. Freedom to Choose Your Fate. Be the scourge of the galaxy, or its savior. A life of combat and struggle not your thing? Become an intergalactic trader and influence the galaxy one deal at a time. Not interested in being a Ã‚Æ’??good guyÃ‚Æ’??? Take on a life of piracy and plunder your way through sectors, creating havoc wherever you go, then docking at pirate stations for supplies as needed. Intense Active Combat. Target enemy ships and maneuver in real time to align devastating broad-sides or crippling strafing runs. Deploy drones to do your dirty work or simply confuse the enemy into targeting them instead of you while you deal with the enemy vessel. In Kinetic Void, your skills as a pilot are just as important as the components that make up your ship. Take Direct Control Of Your Ship. Kinetic Void offers three control modes. In cursor-mode, the player can control the ship through keyboard commands, and pan the camera with the mouse in any direction for quick tactical overview"

Its simple controls allow for an endless stream of entrancing new patterns that gently twist and pulse in a relaxing yet fascinating display. A series of lines emanates from the center of the screen. Four crystal orbs sit in the corners. Each one controls an aspect of the pattern. Playing with them reveals the lines are made of small dots that can be twisted into new and complex arrangements. sfÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂre isn't so much a creation tool as it is a voyage of discovery, seeing what beautiful new imagery can appear. Off-center patterns become lovely, simply by tapping either the horizontal or vertical mirror buttons. The entrancing visuals are backed up by a chill soundtrack, with different tunes available.

Your mission is to stop them precisely on top of one another to stack them. If you do the job well, you are rewarded with another block of the same size. However, if you fail to line up the blocks, the part left outside of the underlying block disappears and the next block you get is smaller. The smaller the blocks, the more challenging it is to stack them. Despite its simplicity, MoveUp can get highly engrossing. Each time a piece of your block disappears and the next blocks get smaller, you become more absorbed since you see the end of the game getting closer. Fortunately, you can gradually grow back your blocks by landing several perfect landings in a row. All in all, MoveUp is an excellent choice for some casual VR gaming, especially after a long day. Fire it up, get stacking, and put reality on the back burner, even if for a few minutes. You will not regret it."

There has been a long term conflict between the Ettaze and Trettaze states since the time when the Ettaze ruler decided to accept the fact that the human beings had the rights to co-exist with the demons in the Ettaze state where the majority of the state were the demons. This was the kind gesture of the ruler who gave the human beings the equal opportunities to join the universities and have a working career in the state even when some demons had a notion of looking down upon the humans. Under the leadership of Gabbon, the Ettaze ruler, the humans and demons learned to co-exist with each other which the ruler of Trettaze state could never accept. The ruler of the Trettaze state started to attack them in every possible way, banning imports and exports, barring tourists from the state to enter the territory etc. This had led to a war breaking out between the two states. However, Trettaze was the first one to officially declare the war against the Ettaze and threatened to kill all of the humans and the demons of the state. The ruler of the Ettaze had a hunch that a war between the states would break out anytime. He hired the best warriors of the state, the team of the three Demon Girls called Tri-Demon Girls who were said to be the strongest team of warriors in the state, in order to eliminate the intruders at all costs. Meanwhile, Emiko, the granddaughter of the Ettaze ruler, decided to step in at her own will and helped out the Tri-Demon girls team in her own way in order to protect the state against the intruders. Even as a half-demon she had a strong will and determination to achieve something big. Emiko with her own 'Devil Weapon' begins her journey to defeat the enemies, and to become the best warrior in the state and abroad. You play as Emiko and your mission is to fight against the enemies in order to protect the weak. Key Features: 15 Levels to play! Different kinds of enemies including three-headed monster! Lots of deadly traps and obstacles to overcome! 3 Firing modes which include regular, laser and Plasma modes. Ability to freeze the enemies and double jump! Story Driven!

SC2KRender is an open-source program that loads SimCity 2000Ã‚Æ’?Ã‚Â½ map files (*.sc2) and renders them in 3D. Over 180 unique models were reimagined so you can explore your metropolis like never before. Transforming the 2D world into 3D has limitations and things that just aren't feasible. These design limitations have been solved by studying 3D Maxis games of the early 90s which made use of the SC2 map file format. Please note this program is not endorsed, sponsored, or otherwise affiliated with Maxis or Electronic Arts and all assets (code and graphics) are original works. What game engine are you using? SC2KRender is an open-source project written using DirectX 11 and C++17, it does not use a game engine. A stripped-down version of DirectX ToolKit was used, which is a collection of helper classes and functions for DirectX. Some features of this homebrew include multisampling anti-aliasing, frustum culling, and Direct2D/DirectWrite integration for text rendering. How can I create my own maps? You will need to legally obtain a copy of SCURK or WinSCURK to create maps, or purchase SimCity 2000Ã‚Æ’?Ã‚Â½ and either load in your saved map or use the included copy of SCURK which comes with it. The Team: Aleksander Krimsky: Programming and Art Thomas Nelson: Lead Artist Various people who have helped along the way are included in the source files available on GitHub. Accomplished Decompress and parse map data Render water, terrain, and building data Fullscreen, borderless, and windowed mode Steam release Future Plans Textures for terrain and models Lighting with day and night modes Render underground data (tunnels, pipes) Link power lines Tentative/Stretch Goals Simulation with cars, boats, planes, etc. Support for AR/VR Help Section Why do objects 'flicker' for me? This can be due to MSAA struggling with some geometries on buildings that use triangular faces, try turning off MSAA to see if the issue is fixed. I will be looking into finding a more permanent fix in the future. Why do objects still 'flicker' for me? This could be due to z-fighting if your camera is very far away from the scene. Try zooming into the scene and see if the issue is resolved. The problem may take a bit more effort to try and resolve. Why is this thing so damn laggy? The map size is 128 * 128 = 16384 possible models, not counting 'scenery' objects. Frustum culling is a feature that prevents rendering objects that are not within your camera, so try going more to the ground-level of a city for better fps. Unfortunately the pipeline for graphics rendering is largely single threaded with the exception of 'command lists' which is an NVidia only-feature. What are you going to do about the performance? The current goal is to work on a technique known as instancing, that should help performance a lot."

The genre of this work is sound novel. Unlike general games, living being set in a realistic life of the present age is drawn. The theme of the story is 'invisible wound, darkness of the heart.' Sound novel is like adding music and graphics to the novel, While playing, we will advance the game by reading the sentences displayed. What the player does is just to read the sentences that basically come up to the end, Even those who do not know the sound novel at all or those who have not played the game, It is a very easy-to-play game. Those who do not have the experience of playing the game or those who have less experience are hard to be attached to the game Although it may have the impression that it is, there is no difficult operation at all.

Ãƒâ€ ?Ã‚ÂSynopsisÃƒâ€ ?? The stage of the story is a real life in contemporary Japan. The theme of the story is 'invisible wound, darkness of the heart.' What is spoken is the story of a single boy. When I received my life in this world. When to live the world. Sometimes it is decided by ignoring the intention and hope of those who received life. Something different from the intention and hope of those who received life may be carried on the back. Abilities, appearance, parents, personality, qualities, accidents, congenital diseases, growing environments. They can not be freely chosen or replaced. Inequality that can not be changed that was carried on such a birth. There was no anti - unacceptable unreasonable fact. A long dark that must be experienced regardless of my will or desire. Unequal things that only the principal understands. An unreasonable fact that somehow never be treated carefully by others. Although they are different in shape from each other, Just being pushed into my heart, I have any person holding it. And living without such harsh suffering I'm starting to get down to the one I was sending. Spring in early puberty. Unexpectedly big darkness is born in my heart. The madness of the gear of life and mind by that darkness ... Ã‚Â¶ÃƒÂº Ã‚Â¶ÃƒÂº Ã‚Â¶ÃƒÂº. The desire to keep living and staying in the real world. I will erase the motivation for such a life without mercy. No understanding, no connection, no motor nerves, no handle. Incompetence, lethargy, no interests indifference, days full of five body satisfaction. Withdrawal, depression, adult children, social phobia. Stupid, human distrust, crime, suicide. The real world is unfair. The existence which created life stuff. If it says that it is God, I will never forgive God. To destroy. Please disappear. But in the real world there is no one who will live his life instead. A man who is supposed to carry a handicap can not escape from the handicap. I will keep on handling handicap with handicap that I decided to carry on for the rest of my life. How easy will it be if you just wait and change? Or will someone manage to do someday? Is it fun to see the human being disappointed in the real world God? As expected after all, is it that you win with your own power? If so, what should I do? Is there no way to save it? I can not ask for help. Nobody can help us. The days that have only been idling do not go away. I can not make it back in time. So I decided to start again from here. Unconvinced. unacceptable. Change the energy of such hatred into courage. I want to keep changing. I want to keep shining.

If you want to get back alive, catch all the straw figures. Howver, you must not be found by the children of the Angel of Death. SEDOMAIRI is a first-person action horror game where you escape from a randomly generated world that looks like an old Japanese house. You have a radio. The radio enables you to detect the distance and direction of enemies and figures. Use the radio to collect all the straw figures while hiding from the enemy, the children of the Angel of Death, and try to get back alive from the 'Sedo'. Gameplay built for fear The distance of the player's lights, the distance of footsteps, the distance of the enemy's vision, and the distance at which the radio can detect the enemy are all calculated and set to make you fearful. This ensures that you will always have the fear that they might be right there. Randomly generated maps This game generates maps with more randomness than my previous game, 'Infection Maze'. Therefore, you can enjoy fresh play even after repeating the game. In addition, a custom mode is included. You can customize the size of the map, the number of enemies, and other aspects of the gameplay by yourself. Battery management for items The items the player has are a light and a radio. Both are essential for exploring the map, but they have batteries that need to be recharged within a certain period of time. It makes you feel tense.

Developer Commentary: Last year I began learning how to program, it was something I had always wanted to do. I used the Twine Interactive Fiction Engine to experiment and learn. I started off with simple tests, which eventually evolved into large games: A train game, where you were stuck on a train and you could shovel coal and drink tea and look out the window at the random scenery selected for that day. It was quite zen. I also created a game based on Edgar Alan Poe's, 'The Raven.' It was an educational game that sought to take a really long poem and dissect it with comics, gifs, and mini-games. People liked it, and I had a fun time dressing up ravens in various costumes for it. Those games were more art than game according to the community. That was a fair opinion, the mechanics were as limited as my knowledge. I wasn't satisfied to just create art though. I wanted to make a game that was unmistakably a game. I set a goal, I was going to make a 100+ level game with maps and mechanics and puzzles. I wasn't going to take a whole decade either, I made an effort to work on it every day, even if I was tired so that I could someday finish it. At first I didn't even know how to make a map. Then I discovered arrays and how to use them. It was magical seeing my character walk around on the map I put together. I spent all day at work coming up with theories as to how I could implement the various features I wanted to put in the game. Errors. Errors. Constant errors. I'd spend all day just trying to get one thing to work. My determination paid off and the mechanics I kept hammering at started to work. Usually at that point they were clunky and flawed. I'd end up completely re-doing them, but I didn't mind, every error was a chance to learn better techniques. I hope that the love put into the game makes it all the more enjoyable to play."

In order to clear blocks, you must right-click and drag paths through the arrows to set up chain reactions of like-colored blocks.

CHARACTERS Rena is a sweet funny girl that is serious when it comes down to business. She is pretty short, but despite that, nothing scares her and she can talk back to anyone. The girl only teases the people that mean something to her and that's what happens with the protagonist too. She has a great business and is one of the best talents regarding potions, but never brags about it. The girl knows that people don't take her seriously because of her looks, but she managed to show them how imposing she is by her hard work. Sana is a elf warrior but that's not what her whole personality revolves around. Despite her stern look, she is a person that values life more than anything and thinks it is better to retreat sometimes from fights and try again than to die a hero. She is a smart, strong woman that has some love for humans and other people, despite them being against her kind. She knows Rena and that helps her trust the mc more since he came from her. Georgia is a strong woman, both physically and mentally. She leads a bunch of men in her blacksmith shop and doesn't respond to anyone. She is a very important person and the best in the town, making weapons and armors for the king and people close to him. She lost a close friend in a battle but doesn't tell anyone about it. Since then, she swore to not participate anymore in these sorts of things. Although she makes items that kill people, she doesn't see all battles as something that should never exist but more like a necessary evil. Angami is a strong but weird naga warrior. She has to watch over the MC but despite that being an inconvenience for her, she barely complains about it. She has to train the recruits all over the kingdom and despite her tough look, she loves to joke around and tease, especially with people close to her. The woman is older than the mc by twelve years but no one else knows that about her. She started this by helping Georgia, but warmed up to the protagonist and even bring him food from her place. Yuna is a cheeky succubus that only hunts the best guys in the town. Despite her sexy attitude, she is overwhelmed by the MC's kindness and falls in love for the first time in her long life. She is made to attract people so that was never a problem for her, so she can't explain how the protagonist managed to refuse her advances in the first night. She is almost never serious, but gets interested in what humans do and even cooks for the mc as a gesture of gratitude. Yuna tries to tease the protagonist but always falls short, getting embarrassed and ending up being the one that gets teased more. FEATURES Ã‚Æ’Ã‚ÂÃ‚Â¾ Fun and challenge match-3 gameplay.

"In Case of Emergency, Release Raptor",2016-08-29,0.0,0.0,nan,,,,nan,nan,"NOTE: This game is very unfinished and is free for you to enjoy because we thought what is there was fun and worth you being able to tinker with. We make no claim that this is a complete experience. It was a passion project for Chris, and a lot of time was poured into this, and we wanted to let you faff about with it. If you leave a review, then reviewing it based on what it actually is (a freebie tech demo) is appreciated. Be a raptor, feel like one, and smash robots to bits. Procedurally-assembled 3D environments set in a scenic futuristic dystopia. Free release of an aborted Early Access title. We hope you enjoy it! Note that this is an AS-IS release, based on popular demand, rather than us taking it down completely. Sell Me The Idea In One Sentence If I have to convince you why being any form of dromaeosaurid is freaking awesome, then I'm not sure we can be friends. This game is carefully crafted to give you the closest possible feeling of being one of these glorious monsters -- then turning you loose to do fun stuff. WhatÃ‚Æ’??s The Point? 1. For the pure fun of the thing. In 1993, a certain game let you be a raptor. The controls were iffy. The levels were short and static. It's very dated. Yet many of us still dust it off periodically -- just to be a raptor. Release Raptor gives you a far more satisfying, modern, dynamic experience. 2. For a power trip. For speedrunning and finesse, you're on an invincible rampage. It's not about IF you can do it, but how WELL you do it. Your performance is evaluated, so mistakes still have consequences without interrupting the flow of the game. 3. To play with kids. I want to be able to play this with my 5 year old son, but still have dismemberment (because that's cool). How to do that without blood or gore? Robots! Little robots = pouncing targets"

REVIEWS Upload VR: Winner of 2021 Upload Awards - Hidden Gem. Mare is a breathless beauty of a VR game Ã‚Æ’?? simplistic in its progression perhaps but never anything less than astonishing to take in. The VR Grid: ItÃ‚Æ’??s not about the destination, but the journey as they say, and Mare is one helluva journey. From the opening moments of the game, all the way to itÃ‚Æ’??s conclusion, I was enamored by the presentation and the story. Mare is nothing short of breathtaking and a welcome change of pace to the to action-packed, fast-paced titles I have been playing of late. Its a strikingly beautiful yet solemn adventure that pushes you ever forward toward the unknown. 6DOF Reviews: Mare is a title I can easily recommend to anybody who has an appreciation for beauty and mystery. It evokes a mood unlike any IÃ‚Æ’??ve experienced in VR.. It may be brief, but its impact will far outlive its duration, proving beyond a doubt that itÃ‚Æ’??s the quality of our experiences that matter, and not their duration. Mare is a class act from start to finish. It's a macabre and mysterious adventure that offers a haunting experience that long outlives its light puzzles and relatively brief playtime. VR Focus: A puzzle experience with beautiful scenery and a mysterious plotline all about a girl who needs your help. The barren environment coupled with the superb musical score ensures Mare has an ambience and soul few VR projects achieve."

Fearing for his sovereignty, contacts a secret corporation for the development of biological weapons of mass destruction, with name - Zero Experimental Establishment or ZEE. The project is allocated funds and a place of development - a remote corner of the country - the Montib island, cut off from the world, with a small population and no modern infrastructure. The deafening success of experiments is comparable only with the fundamental failure of the all development. The next monthly report says about the fall of a helicopter with samples of biological weapons on the island. And a week later, after reports of the observation - of infection of local residents, communication with the employees of the corporation, and indeed with anyone in general, disappears. The government makes a decision in secret from the world community and, despite the protests of the residents of the country who have relatives there, cut off the entire Montib island from the external world, and under pressure forces ZEE to investigate what happened. Despite the military patrolling the sea around the island and the likelihood of dying from the virus, the flow of people trying to get there is not running out. Someone wants to find relatives and friends, help residents, and someone wants to take possession of the abandoned property of a corporation or just have fun in a place where the laws no longer work. Why are you there - you decide. The release version of the game will include: - We have a huge map 20 by 20 kilometers, to reach the other end you need at least an hour and a half, with villages, cities and military bases - The map contains areas of summer, autumn and winter, with different air temperatures - Spawn is located along the entire southern coast (no respawns in the center of the map near military bases with top loot!) - Two factions. Marauders and Hunters (players will be divided into two factions, depending on their actions. Marauders will be those who kill players, Hunters - who kill bots and marauders. Each faction will have its own camp with a store) - Extraction of resources, from the simplest tree to valuable gold (gold will be a currency that can be exchanged for some things) - Transport with physics close to real, with repairs and refueling (one or two helicopters per server, which will not be easy to assemble) - Crafting and cooking (such dishes as ukha or mushroom soup will give an hourly buff of one or another characteristic, so cooking makes sense) - Building bases (wood - stone - metal) - Missions (missions will appear on the map, simulating various situations)"

More than 200 years had passed since colonization on Mars had begun. A slow process of terraformation had begun, occurring in the atmosphere and modifying its chemical composition. Despite the rarefied air and radiation, millions of people inhabited the planet. Mars was exploited for its mineral resources, but it served above all to reach the moons of Jupiter. In 2437, a new mineral called Ixenio was discovered on those moons. Ixenio was known to be indestructible over time, the hardest of hardest metals and able to generate an incredible quantity of energy through exposure to photon beams... it was the new black gold. In 2512, Mars was aware that it had become a superpower and it took advantage of the conflict between the Euro America League and the Asiatic Union to form and declare the Independent Martian Kingdom, I.M.K. The Asiatic Union sided with the I.M.K. while the Euro American League still claimed its own rights. All out war was, by then, at the door... The I.M.K. suddenly attacked Moon Base, using the asteroid fortress Abraxis as its logistic base. It conquered Moon Base and exploited it to send troops on Earth in support of the Asiatic Union. It was the beginning of Interplanetary War I. Key Features: Action Shooter with a tactical approach. 360 degree shooting system. More than 16 level: fight on earth and in space. Unlock 17 weapons as you play the game. Survive in large scale battles."

You will follow Nemus story, a magic caster that was sealed for 500 years. Now she suffers from amnesia. She has to recover her lost momories to discover her past and find out what happend to her. Istoria is a game about strategy and Character Customisation. You will be able to change and combine Classes and change Items ( Weapons, Artifacts and consumable Items ) for all playable Characters, to fit your strategy to overcome your foes. The Game also features many Side and Challenge Missions to unlock more customization choices, like BluePrints with let you craft new/different Items. Turn-Based Strategy: Combat is Turn-Based and seperates in to stages, the Planning Phase and the Combat Phase . Planning Phase: Unlike in 'most' Turn-based Strategy Games, you have to plan more than just on 'action/attack'. This means each turn you have to plan multiple 'actions/attacksÃ‚Æ’?? for each of your Units should make that turn, before you enter the Combat Phase. Units/Characters can make more than one action/attack each turn which can make a turn quite complex/difficult to plan. Combat Phase: If you are finished/satisfied with you Planning Phase you will end your turn starting the Combat Phase. During the combat Phase you have no way to change you desisions and all Units/Characters will take turns to activate and use 'actions/attacksÃ‚Æ’?? until all activations are resolved and the next turn start. Customize your Characters: Every playable Character can spent upto 10 level in upto 4 Classes (you can mix/combine Classes to suit your strategy). Classes can have a level beween 0 and 5, unlocking Skills and/or Passives with each level. Every Character can equip atleast one Weapon, two consumable Items and one Artifacts. While completing Missions/the Story you will also be able to choose between rewards to permanently alter/enthance your Characters. Example Character: For this example we will take a look at the Character Elysa , who is a Water Spirit that joins the party in Chapter 1. After joining the party Elysa can use 4 Classes (as the game progresses she can/will unlock more) . For this build we want to make her a support character . First we will spende 8 Classlevel (Chapter 2) , 5 in the Enhancer Class and 3 in the Cleric Class . This will unlock these Skills (black) and Passives (grey) . For the Weapon we equip [Tome: Chilling Storm] which grants her the [Chilling Storm] Skill without using the Hydromancer Class. As an Artefact we will use [Unholy Arsenal] with has a passive that grants 2 additional Skillslots, with is a perfect for a support Character with many support Skills. As consumable Item we equipen a [Mana Potion] and [Ironskin Potion] (to increase her weak physical defence) . For the last step we have to choose with Skill we want to equip on her Skillslots. Every Character can choose upto 5 Skills, but thanks to the [Unholy Arsenal] (Artifact) we can equip 7 Skills (8 if we count the Weapon Skill) . Our Skill choices are: [Holy Smite] a basic holy attack spell. [Divine Plea] a holy healing spell. [Purge] a spell to remove magical effects. [Imbue Power] a buff spell that increases damage done. [Dome of Protection] a buff spell that increases defences. [Magic Cocoon] a buff spell that reduces damage take to 0 for one turn. [Undying Stamina] a buff spell that increases actionpoint regeneration. [Chilling Storm] a cold spell that deals damage and slows enemy units. And the Passives are: [Equality] Elysas Character Passive that can incresse the effect of Attack, Buff and Healing Skills, but only after using a Skill of the other type. [Mana Discharge] the Spirit Race Passive, this will restore mana (party) if this unit dies. [Radiant Faith] incresses healing. [Enhanced Spirit] incresses mana regeneration.

Humanity had enjoyed a golden age for over 250 years, where things like war, disease, and poverty were considered a relic of the past. The galaxy is now divided into major regions, the industrialized core systems controlled by the mega-corporations, and thousands of small colonies that make up the frontier. The mega-corporations use mass consumerism to keep the core systems population in check, which requires a continuous flow of resources from the frontier, which in turn creates a conflict between the corporations and colonies over the resources on the colony's planet.

Can you beat all 10? Good Luck !!!!!!!! Notes: If your mouse doesn't work when playing, try changing the sensitivity in the options. This game was made by me and my twin brother, and we are now seniors in high school. I had a lot of fun making this game, and I hope you have fun playing it :D 10/28: I noticed a lot of people have been saying the difficulty curve between levels is too high, so to make it easier, I will give hints for each level below. Level 1: Pretty Straightforward Level 2: If you are struggling at the jumps toward the end of the level (where it starts to get narrow), hug the inside walls to take the shortest path to the next platform. At the end of the level, the last jump is an option between left and right, MAKE SURE TO GO LEFT. Level 3: The dropper is introduced in this level, where you maneuver the character in order to make it into the opening below. In the dropper at the end of the level, try to go through the edges of the holes instead of the center in order to be able to get through the following holes. Level 4: Relatively straightforward, but you have to strafe a lot in the air, as well as do 360's. Try to get used to the movement mechanics. Level 5: The first jump is pretty difficult, so be precise in jump timing and movement in the air. After this jump, turn right immediately and look down to get to the next platform. Remember to strafe in the air if you feel you are jumping too far. Level 6: Path gets pretty narrow from here, so if your sensitivity isn't already high, increase it so that you are able to change direction quickly. Level 7: Strafing in the air is important to maneuver through the opening. Move very precisely during the 3rd jump to reach the next platform. During the 5th and 6th jump, look back at where you jumped from while in the air to see where to go. Near the end of the level, there is a large platform where you are able to move freely. After this point, go to the next jump area, hug the wall and start hugging the other side of the wall you just jumped over. Keep doing this. Level 8: Be very quick and precise in movements. Near the end of the level, there is a large room. Hug the large chunks of wall in front of you during jumps. Level 9: In the beginning of the level, do a 180 in the air and try to get above the initial spawn room. The level is extremely narrow and it is hard to react to new obstacles, so try to memorize them as you die so you know where to go beforehand. Level 10: Pretty straightforward where to go, but very difficult. If you have any more questions about where to go or what to do, put it in the reviews/discussions and I'll try to answer them. Good Luck! : )"

You play as an immortal amnesiac wizard who must rebuild his spellbook and slay his rival. The game consists of 25 randomly generated levels, each filled with procedurally generated challenges that will test your creativity and strategic thinking abilities. Rift Wizard Features: Open ended character advancement with deep synergies and spell interactions Huge library of spells and passive skills to build from Low randomness, high player agency Diverse and varied monster design High difficulty, permadeath, limited resources Crisp 1990s retro RPG aesthetics Rift Wizard is inspired by classics such as Nethack, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, Brogue, and Tales of Maj'Eyal, but pushes the genre in a more strategic, combat focused direction. In some ways it is closer to a board game than an RPG. There isn't much plot or exploration in Rift Wizard- just epic wizard battles and deep buildcraft from start to finish. I'm creating Rift Wizard because I want to push the boundaries of the genre. I want to build a deep and challenging roguelike worth exploring for a thousand hours or more. A game with hundreds of potential strategies to try. A game where each run is a novel and exciting intellectual challenge. A game that inspires the player to be crafty, creative, and brilliant."

Introduction to the Rogue Spirit world: For thousands of years, the people of the Kingdom of Midra lived in relative harmony and peace. From generation to generation, the oldest of tales were told over and over again. The stories told of the great Chaos: A Demon King who was sealed away by a hero of long-forgotten ages. Over time, the residents of the land turned the tale into a legend, then a myth, until it was all but forgotten. Days passed by in this peaceful slumber. The denizens' obliviousness to their own terrifying past weakened the chains of the prison containing the Demon King, until one day they finally broke. The Chaos awakened and the horrifying nightmares of the forgotten past came back to life. He was once more known to every inhabitant of the land Ã‚Æ’?? child, adult and elderly alike. He sowed fear in the hearts of the brave, as an inevitable war came along with him. Those who could fight did, and fell. Those who were not strong enough to fight were possessed by demonic energy. The Chaos left no warrior's body alone and absorbed it into his army. Leaving no hostages behind, he incorporated inhabitants across all social classes and sorts, from lowly beggars to the noblest lords. His power grew to be so unimaginable that no mortal could stand against it. As a final resort, the Last Ones, monks of the Forgotten Monastery who still have a memory of what once happened, performed the ritual of summoning to bring back from the spirit world our Hero who sealed away the Chaos in the distant past. You play as the Ghost, the summoned Spirit of the Prince of the Kingdom of Midra, wandering your land. Passing through your kingdom's villages, forests and marshes, you'll have to defeat and possess your foes to acquire their skills and adapt your combat style to different circumstances. Each defeated enemy is an opportunity for a body with better chance of survival."

Well, now you can cut each other's arms and legs off as you've always dreamed! Unlike 'proper' games, Endless Knight lets you continue to fight even after you have become separated from your limbs. Sadly the game does not permit the battle to continue after your friends actual death, for 'technical' reasons. Murdered and humiliated all your friends? That's okay, it happens to us all. Lucky for you, Endless Knight also features a not entirely 'tacked-on' single player experience, complete with an absurd story and songs! Slaughtered your way through the wonderfully crafted story mode? Take on the challenging but probably not impossible 'Final Fifty' mode for the ultimate climax of murderous satisfaction. Mmmmmmm. Completed 'Final Fifty'? Oh no, that's pretty much all there is. The mechanics of Endless Knight are different from what youÃ‚Æ’??d find in most fighting games. There are no combos or 'special moves'. The focus is on reaction based blocking, as failure to block will have dire consequences. Due to this alternative focus, Endless Knight might take a few minutes to adapt to, but we hope that once you get the gist, you will love it as much as we do! Played alone or with friends, mastering Endless Knight can be jolly good fun!"

Set on the backdrop of unique minimalist art style you will test your timing and your patience as you play through multiple different game modes. Practice mode gives players the ability to let them choose the stages they want to practice on, you can either choose a stage directly from Stage Mode or build your own level using the level editor and play that. Stage Mode is a casual game mode where you have the ability to play at your own pace working your way through 50 increasing difficult stages, the amount of retries and/or failed attempts you commit while working your way through the 50 stages are tracked and evaluated so they can be shown off to friends or posted on Steam. Speed Mode is a more competitive game mode that samples some of the hardest stages in the game, and then times how long it takes for you to work your way through them, final times can be posted on the Steam community page to see who #1 is. This is the first release by Fingertip Games UK which is a new indie start-up being run by one sole developer. If it was not for the support of the Steam community through the Steam Greenlight pathway, this game and start-up would truly not exist today. The game managed to garner major feedback during its Greenlight campaign and these inputs and supportive comments have gone a long way in shaping the future updates for the game. IÃ‚Æ’??d like to give a big thank-you to everyone who either supported us in the Greenlight campaign or have bought the game thus far (and people who will hopefully purchase the game in the future), every little bit of support we can get helps to keep me working on things that people hopefully enjoy. 2016 is going to be a busy year for the game, starting with the January 2016 update V1.1, the game has been streamlined and re-coded from the ground up so itÃ‚Æ’??s ready to support the slew of content that is planned throughout the year. V1.2 is planned for a late March/April 2016 release and will contain the following: - Adds 2 new core game mechanics. (Details closer to release) - Adds 20 new stages to Stage Mode. - Adds another sample to Speed Mode. - Improves and expands some capabilities of the Level Editor. (Details closer to release) V1.3 is planned for a late August/September 2016 release and will contain the following: - Adds 30 new stages to Stage Mode. - Adds the random sample capability to Speed Run. (Details closer to release) - Adds 3 new Mini-games. (Details closer to release) V1.4 is planned for a late September/October 2016 release and will contain the following: - Visual Upgrade to ball movements and effects. - Implements physics based particle effects and responses. - Implements the color palate options where you can color the UI and objects in the game to fit your own style. - Implement the ability to share levels you create in the Level Editor through either a copy or paste code or the Steam Workshop."

First, we built the most realistic 2D racer ever... and then we smashed it up into a bizarre party game out of a desire to play a Ã‚Æ’??racingÃ‚Æ’?Ã‚Â game with more than just racing fans. We provide a physics playground with sim-like cars, minimal rules at the start, and you decide what to do with it by adding wacky rules between races. Good luck keeping your wheels on! Ã‚Æ’?Ã‚Â­ Includes the best 6-8 player couch minigame on the planet: Prison Dodgecar! Whaaaaat??? Old school gets a new-school makeover with more damageable physics objects than you can shake a two-dimensional polygon at. And, oh, the skids marks!

With debris everywhere from lost wheels, broken cars, oily tire tracks, various track objects, and up to 8 players on one screen generally making a mess of it all, just getting to the finish line can be a friend-testing brawl of gasoline-fueled tenacity. Welcome to the petrolpunk world of Globetrotter Racing where it's 1975, The Great War was the only world war, and microelectronics do not exist... probably because no one cared about going small after Nikola Tesla and his research institute learned to harness the power of lightningÃ‚Æ’??to put it simplyÃ‚Æ’??and invented the Tesla ShieldÃ‚Æ’?Ã‚Â½ for use in automotive safety and generalized pedestrian protection (GPP).

Thereby groups and combinations of landscapes are formed, such as forests, villages or water bodies, and you are rewarded with points depending on how well the tile fits. On some tiles you will also encounter special objects that give you a quest: For example, the windmill wants to border 6 grain fields, the locomotive wants to be connected to 10 tracks or the deer wants to inhabit a forest with at least 50 trees. Fulfill these quests to get more tiles to continue the expansion of your landscape. The game ends when the tile stack is used up.

The session weÃ‚Æ’??ve built is suitable for everyone, both beginners and those already on the yoga path. During the practice we want to strengthen our attentiveness. We practice to the exact extent of our abilities at this moment, and from the principle of non-injury, or AHIMSA. During the practice we are attentive to our bodies, especially our breathing, it directs us. Practice is performed unhurriedly, quietly. Yoga is restraining the fluctuating consciousness, without tension and without strength. If during the VR session you experience dizziness, discomfort or pain, itÃ‚Æ’??s always possible to stop and take off the headset. The session will stop automatically and will resume when the headset is put on again. The more we recruit our awareness during the session, the more the practice will be complete and deeper. The VirtuaLiron yoga practice package includes 3 sessions of different length. 30, 60 and 90 minutes. You can choose the form of the teacher from 3 different avatars: A female body avatar where subtle changes in the body colors indicate the breathing sequence. A muscle model avatar where you can see during the practice which muscles are exerting force, and a skeleton avatar that shows the bones structure, engulfed in a transparent body envelope. The teacher will always be in your field of view, regardless where your head is pointing to. This is a fundamental advantage over practice in the real world. You do not need to exit the posture or the flow of movement in order to see what the teacher is doing. While you practice, your head rotation also determines the angle you will see the teacher from."

Each tile you move to transforms you into a different weapon: on a Blades hex you can slice enemies on either side of you, on an Arrow you can launch yourself through two enemies in a row. Between waves, you choose how to build out the grid, and upgrade your most used hexes with new abilities. Hammer: lets you stay put and smash a single enemy in front of you Blades: kill enemies on either side as you move Arrow: plunge right through an enemy and come out the other side Repair: repairs any damage you've taken when you move here Teleport: move to anywhere else on the grid Acid: strips tough enemies of their armour, leaving them vulnerable Killing bugs earns you upgrades for your hexes, and each hex type can be cross-bred with every other type to take on some of its properties. Upgrade an Arrow with Acid and it can kill armoured enemies. Upgrade a Hammer with Blades and you can kill three enemies at once without moving. Upgrade a Teleporter with a Repair and you'll be healed each time you teleport. Upgrades can even be stacked, so you can end up with an Arrow that propels you with infinite range, kills everything in your path, penetrates armour, knocks back everyone near your destination, heals you, and doubles as a teleporter. The idea for tiles determining your weapon came from the iOS game Imbroglio by Michael Brough, which is great, and Morphblade is developed and released with his permission."

Fictorum,2017-08-09,0.0,9.99,nan,,,,nan,nan,"A reign of terror never feels so satisfying as when you leave a literal pile of rubble in your wake. Giving wizards a much-needed makeover, Fictorum is an action role-playing game that features fully-destructible structures, a randomized node-based world map, and a satisfying magic system with on-the-fly spell shaping and customization. In Fictorum, your mage wields real, legendary power right from the startÃ‚Æ’??unlike those found in most magic-centric games. Our magic system uses a dynamic and intuitive spellcasting and shaping system that grants the player an unrivaled level of customization and reconfiguration. Up to three runes can be applied to a spell, each affecting a different spell characteristic. The runes are easily swapped to suit the playerÃ‚Æ’??s current need, interest, or whim. You might amplify ice blasts to freeze enemies in place, expand the radius of a fireball explosion to crumble a bridge and hinder pursuers, or chain a lightning attack together to strike several targets in a cluster. Shaping makes spellcasting much more tactical and satisfying. Rather than starting out as a hapless farm boy who stumbles into his powers and avoids enemies or entire areas until leveling up, players take on the role of an established wizarding badass, hell-bent on his mission for revenge. Yet challenge is abundantÃ‚Æ’??the wizard must bring down a sprawling empire by himself, besting scores of bandits, cadres of Inquisitors, and hordes of corrupted abominations on his quest for vengeance. The protagonist has access to unlimited magical powers, making the game less about spamming that one spell that works passably well until it becomes upgradable. The experience is more about tailoring your magical arsenal, giving the player a wide range of freedom and the ability to effectively, efficiently, and enthusiastically destroy every obstacle. The randomly-generated world map features locations where every structure (from large buildings to bookshelves to tables to even a lone fork) can be demolished."

Somehow, they know they must avoid the anomalous threats contained by the SCP Foundation and escape before it's too late... Important! This game is in VERY EARLY development! If it sounds like something you might enjoy, check back in a few months when it's been further developed. This build has been released with the intent of gathering feedback and allowing anyone who wants to participate in development to give their suggestions. Overview: 1-4 Players start on a board with various tiles that lead to an escape. Players take turn rolling a die to determine how far they can move along the board. Players must navigate the board while avoiding deadly anomalous threats. Certain SCPs will also be navigating the board, and must be considered when moving around. Tiles have unique effects that trigger: when arrived at, when left from, when landed on, and when died on. Some of these give Evidence Points (EP). Once a player escapes, their EP will be converted to Credits ($C), but if a player dies their EP is reset. All non-player slots will be filled with AI that compete as a real player would. The Board: The 'Board' refers to the map that players will navigate. There is 1 board in the current release and more planned. Boards vary in theme, meaning different boards will have different visual and audio queues. Boards will also have at least 1 mechanic that alters the gameplay as the game is played. The current board is called 'Meadows', and presents a bright, friendly environment which lulls visitors into a certain sense of security. The Tiles: As players navigate the board, they will land on 'Tiles'. Tiles have various effects, and are mainly used as a way to gain EP. Some tiles are owned by certain SCPs, such as the 106 tile in the Early Access version. This tile, for example, changes location at the start of every round, and if landed on will result in the players death. More of these are planned for full release. Enemies: Players navigate the board during their 'turn', but while it isn't their turn some SCPs will also navigate the board. 173, the board enemy in this release, will walk around the board at the start of the round, and will initiate a short minigame with any player who is on the same tile as it. Evidence Points: As players navigate the board they find 'evidence'. These pieces of evidence have points assigned which refer to their value. Upon escaping, the player will be compensated in $Credits depending on their EP. Credits: Credits are the main currency of the game. Total credits earned will determine who wins the game. They can also be spent on character customisation (not yet implemented)"

If played during Defcon, you can connect to the CTF servers to compete against other hackers. Outside of Defcon these challenges will randomly create new solutions. This will give you additional play even outside of the conference. Developers Note: This is a solo-dev volunteer-time developed game. Please be patient. Occulus should work as I'm using OpenXR but I won't update the steam supported VR headsets until I have had time to fully test it. Defcon Safemode Release Defcon 28 is the initial release and the first VR game (or any game for that matter) that the Car Hacking Village has ever released. It was a 1 person, nights and weekend project so lots of things didn't make the final cut. Some bugs still survived but should be pretty minor (the points on the watch are wrong). Please use the Community forums to let me know what worked, didn't work and what you would like to see in future versions or other game ideas. If you are on the Defcon discord look for [CHV] zombieCraig in #chv-vr-support-text channel."

We love games with a strong narrative drive that tackle important social issues and aim to set that standard within our own work.

Time is a precious resource to us all. Every minute in the game is a real-world minute and The Occupation is played over a fixed time length so make sure your actions count. Your watch can be used to set alarms and timers to help keep track of important objectives such as time delayed safes so you donÃ‚Æ’??t have to hang around whilst security is searching for you somewhere you shouldn't be.

Or, you may be actively involved in trying to create true change. We love that, in most countries, people have a choice in this, and thatÃ‚Æ’??s how we wanted to approach The OccupationÃ‚Æ’??s gameplay design.

My name is Ivan, and I'm the creator of Ailment . I'm a solo developer and this one is my very first game. I started not a long time ago, and it took me around 9 months to complete this game, drawing and coding and doing lots of other stuff related to game development. Originally the game was made for iOS and Android phones, and it was released on May 1, 2019, and it got downloaded around 250K times within 3 months with pretty good reviews (4.6 AppStore/GooglePlay). It became Game of the Day on AppStore on September 28, and it got into the Indie Corner on Google Play Store and still remains there. It seemed insane for me, for a newbie solo-developer who never has made a game before. Players were asking whether Ailment would be released on PC, and now there you go! Check it out and let me know your thoughts! 'I thought this game was just another cheap ad-packed waste, but I started playing and found it fun and challenging. Definitely download' This is a really well put together game! Even for just having one person working on it and handling it, the game looks and feels very professional and is just really fun to play. Within an hour or 2 of playing it, I immediately recommended the game to my friends! All around it's a great game. 'I never write reviews about games or other apps just because I don't get passionate enough to take the time to write a review. However, this game has changed that for me. This game is really well thought out with a bunch of little hidden eggs from space movies. Really enjoyed the game while it lasted. Really hope these guys will come out with another game like this! Would even be paying a few dollars for it.'' 'Lived up to my expectations. I definitely recommend it to whoever is reading this.' Ailment is a pixel-art action game which takes place on a spaceship in a far away galaxy. The main character wakes up in a spaceship after being unconscious for three days to discover the whole crew had turned into enemeis. The last thing he remembers was returning from another ship where he was on a rescue mission, but everyone on that ship was already dead... He has to remember what happened and find out the truth. Features: * Many different weapons * Brutal death animations * Exciting story * Pixel art graphics * Always talkative character * Atmospheric sound effects * Dramatic surroundings * Ability to bring NPCs with you"

The whole process consists of 32 rounds, each round 'defense' and 'escape' play, two play through to the next round. (Because many players do not like to be forced to become monsters, the current version is the default choice to skip the escape mode.) You don't have to destroy all the creatures in the 'Tower Defense'. After each round of play, Hp will be auto reset. You don't have to save all of the same kind in the 'escape' game, and of course it will lose some 'energy'. Each kind of turret has its own unique effect, through the collocation of various turrets to get the best defense. Each kind of monster has its own unique attributes, using the properties of the turret to combat monsters. The core of the game is 'energy absorption'. (similar to 'thieves', 'plunder'). That is, the attack of the defense tower will draw energy from the monster, and accumulating energy can build more defense towers. (it's hard to defend if you have not enough energy.)

At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat. TRAVEL During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands. If you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat. COMBAT You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever. A science-fiction post-apocalypse Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman. In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety. If you can survive long enough to find it."

Suspicions and allegations run rife throughout the city, as an insidious drug known as Ã‚Æ’??ShardÃ‚Æ’?? spreads throughout the underworld. With the cityÃ‚Æ’??s future in doubt, three hardened citizens rise to discover the truth and uncover a conspiracy threatening to alter the cityÃ‚Æ’??s fate. Inspired by tech noir classics, Disjunction is an intensely atmospheric stealth-action RPG that follows a trinity of interwoven narratives, and features a reactive story where your actions have real, persistent consequences. Choose your playstyle and use an arsenal of futuristic tech, cybernetic upgrades and weapons to blast through levels in brutally fast combat, or take a silent approach by using stealth and non-lethal takedowns to leave without a trace. Nobody needs to dieÃ‚Æ’?ÃƒÂ unless you decide they must.

Find upgrade kits to reach your true potential and become a feared killer or remain anonymous throughout New York's shady underground. Reactive Story: Experience a reactive story shaped by your actions. Your approach to situations can have serious consequences for the future of New York City, with the repercussions of choosing to spare or kill even one person rippling throughout the underworld.

The World: The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of AmericaÃ‚Æ’??s cities. These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals."

"VR Time Machine Travelling in history: Medieval Castle, Fort, and Village Life in 1071-1453 Europe",2020-07-31,0.0,9.99,nan,,,,nan,nan,"European castles are known for their mysterious brilliance. Many castle owners are either kings, nobles, ministers, or princesses. Each has its own ancient legend about them. However, in the millennium, the hustle and bustle of the past has long been silent, and their masters have turned into dead bones. Castles are everywhere in Europe, and you can find them on the mountains, on the beach, and even around the ancient cities. Perhaps some castles are in disrepair to varying degrees, but they are no less than well-preserved classics. However, the European architectural styles are strikingly elegant in the Middle Ages. Imagine the huge Gothic cathedral and the magnificent castle, which are the protagonists of fairy tales. The ancient castles in Europe originated from the military camps of ancient Rome. In the late Roman Empire, the Romans built some large permanent camps in the border provinces. Most of these camps are square, and each camp has a garrison camp. This can be seen as the predecessor of the later castle. After the demise of the Roman Empire, many countries appeared in the place of Rome, and the entire Western Europe was in a state of chaos. In such a chaotic situation, princes and nobles everywhere began to build castles to protect themselves. Most of the castles in the early Middle Ages were built with civil materials, and were built on a large rammed earth foundation called a 'dike'. Some castles are rammed with mud, and more are built with wood. There are tall towers built inside the fort, and some living facilities such as the main hall, stables and churches are also built beside the tower. A moat was dug around the castle. The fatal weakness of these wooden castles is that they cannot withstand fire. The 9th century was a period of great castle development, and the major improvement in castle construction technology was the advent of the stone castle. After the castle is built, it can not only protect the lords and their families, but also be used to control the surrounding area. Usually the nearby manor produces the items needed in the castle, and the farmers in the manor in the wartime will flee to the castle to seek protection. The medieval castle in Europe is a building with both military and civilian functions. It is not only a fortress used to defend against enemy attacks, but also a residence for nobles and knights. Medieval Europe was a wild place full of conflict, robbery, confrontation and killing. In this kind of chaos, people need to avoid the harbor of war storms, tools to resist the attack of strong enemies, and maintain a weapon of peace and tranquility. As a result, the castle came into being. At that time, building a castle was the most reliable defense in the war, and at least the weaker side could retreat to the castle. The earth and stone material-based castle is enough to resist the cavalry's rapid attack and transform the raid-type quick decisive battle into the attrition battle. Therefore, the purpose of the castle is to defuse the attack of the enemy, especially in medieval Europe. Lords at all levels take the security of the territoryÃ‚Æ’??s personal property as the core task, and make the castle enter the golden age. From the 11th century to the 13th century, the development of the castle entered its heyday. For a time, castles were scattered all over Western Europe. Many of the best medieval castles preserved to this day are in Wales, England. In the late 13th century, King Edward I of the United Kingdom sent troops to conquer Wales. Every time he attacked the ground, he had to choose a key place to build a castle to form a siege of Wales. In this game, we can visit the style of the medieval castle at any time according to our own time. Realistic VR scenes can let you devote yourself to the scene of the castle. Inside you can visit the castle according to your own wishes and your own ideas. Everywhere, if you feel tired during the tour, you can stop and rest"

The ruling royal dynasty of Conussia has been overthrown, and an undead Lich now sits on the throne. As a courtier to the previous regime you were partly responsible for the coup, and as such, your services have been retained by the Lich. As the story unfolds, you learn that there is much more to this occupation than meets the eye, and must choose whether to ally yourself with the Lich and his seductive right-hand woman, with the Resistance to try and undo the damage you have unwittingly done, or to walk the dangerous thin line of the mercenary, loyal to no-one but his friends. Lastly, of course, is the Princess, who from her prison cell holds a terrible secret that could change everything. TKS: The Book of Bondmaids is a story-driven visual novel and sequel to Three Kingdoms Story: Conussia. The game features branching narrative paths and multiple endings, plus six erotic short stories written exclusively for TKS: The Book of Bondmaids by Trude Perkins.

Starmancer,2021-08-05,0.0,19.99,nan,,,,nan,nan,"After a catastrophe on Earth, humanity launches the Starmancer Initiative in a desperate attempt to seek refuge among the stars. Millions of refugees upload their consciousness into your memory banks--entrusting their minds and the future of the human race to an Artificial Intelligence, a Starmancer. To you. Stranded in a strange solar system, your task as a Starmancer is to construct and manage a space station capable of sustaining life for the countless minds trapped in your corrupted memory banks, and return to the fleet--by any means necessary. Starmancer offers gameplay with consequences, a living sandbox environment, crafting, and managing the daily lives of colonists. Create a utopian society where everyone is well fed, happy, and safe. Or go rogue and figure out how many times a colonist can eat wheat before they go crazy. The choice is yours! Sustain Life - Colonists have needs, like hunger and thirst. Build farms and grow crops for food. Place heaters to prevent hypothermia. Construct med bays and assign doctors to treat wounds, cure diseases, and replace limbs. Express Yourself - Customize your station with unique walling, floors, furniture, and tons of weird and wonderful decorations and objects. Repaint objects to achieve your space station interior design dreams! Place cheerful paintings to remind the colonists how friendly and relatable you are, and motivational posters to let them know how much you value their productivity. Design fancy kitchens, luxurious bedrooms, casinos, and industrial docking bays. Power, Water, and Atmosphere - Provide power by connecting machines with wires. Prepare against blackouts by creating separate or redundant grids for your vital machines. Use pipes and water recyclers to convert dirty farm water into clean, drinkable water. Establish separate atmospheres with the help of vents and air ducts. Grow Colonists - Colonists are grown in Incubators, with personas assigned from the minds of Earth refugees stored in memory banks on your station. Create stations full of clones. If tragedy strikes, donÃ‚Æ’??t worry, you can always regrow your favorite colonists! Jobs - Assign roles like farmer, doctor, miner, and security guard. Watch as your rookie chef acquires experience and becomes a seasoned pro, unlocking tastier and more exotic recipes. Unique Colonists - With randomized hair color and style, eye color, and skin color, there are over 8000 visual variations of colonists. These variations go beyond aesthetics, too. Some colonists prefer eating nutrition bricks on the toilet, while others like to drink and socialize in the bar. Every game is different--your station and colonists will be unique to you. Memories - Colonists remember the good (and bad) things that happen to them - until they inevitably require regrowth (accidents happen). Traumatic experiences, like seeing a dead body, will be remembered for a long time. If left unchecked, these memories will be shared, through gossip, until everyone learns about your Life Support malfunction... Leave no witnesses. Personal Relationships - Colonists get extra sad when something bad happens to a friend, but they love to watch an enemy suffer. If you jettison a popular colonist you might have a mutiny on your hands. Missions - Send your bravest colonists on dangerous missions across the galaxy to gather resources and discover precious loot! Be ready to face the consequences, should you fail in your duties as a Starmancer. Invasion - Your colony will be invaded by creatures from outer space. Build traps, arm your colonists, and keep your station secure at all costs. Insanity - A colonist can only witness so many friends being sucked out of air locks before they snap. No one knows what motivates a crazy colonist"

It will tell you the highest score that has been achieved on that level, how many times you have won the level, and how accurate you have been over all the attempts on the level. These stats boards may be reset on a per-level basis if you wish to start over from scratch to try to improve your stats. There is a day/night option as well that will allow you to play at either daytime or nighttime. This can be toggled at the main spawn area next to the shrine at the top of the stairs in-game.

For example, Elena's last mission was to safely recover stolen ancient relics. An unknown thief had ransacked the national museum and got away with the namesakes of the empire's oldest rulers. A team of detectives picked up a trail that led across the border, but then disappeared. The Queen summoned Elena. 'The items stolen are of paramount value to the empire and crown,' she said in a slightly wavering voice. 'We mustn't lose them.' 'I understand, your Majesty,' Elena answered. 'But announcing their disappearance would only complicate the matter, so you must carry out your duty in the strictest secrecy! You shall at once be sent abroad under the guise of an ambassador to carry out your investigation in secret. You must track down the perpetrator and force them to return what was stolen.' Elena soon found herself on a top-secret covert mission of vital interest to the Crown. Her first order of business upon arrival was notifying the local police of the missing valuables. 'Were the items stolen from your hotel or at the port?' Asked the chief of police, his moustache twitching like a walrus'. 'Neither,' Elena answered, 'they were stolen on the boat, but I know for certain the culprit is still here. 'Hm...very well,' the officer let out with an air of authority. 'We'll get on the case at once, don't you worry. There isn't a criminal out there who can slip away from me...' By evening, the list of suspects had been narrowed down to a few names. Elena asked the chief if she could accompany the detectives to identify the culprit, and he gave his permission. Elena was not only sharp as a tack, but was well-versed in the new deductive method, which had already helped her crack open five robbery cases, two murders and one case of destruction of hotel property. In the end, Elena and the detective team tracked down the artifact thief and were just waiting for the judge to sign the arrest warrant, when an urgent telegram came in from the Prime Minister with orders to meet that very night. She had no choice but to return home that very instant and put her operation on hold. What was it that happened in the palace that forced her to abandon her job and return immediately? Join Elena on an unforgettable adventure through an alternate Victorian world across the endless Emperor Desert Valley, the green banks of the Nile, a volcanic island and more!

Easy to play, difficult to master, the Umihara Kawase Trilogy is a collection of three physics-based puzzle/platformer games with over 20 years of gaming history. Developed by the creators of the original game (Kiyoshi Sakai and Toshinobu Kondo), this cult classic was a Japanese indie smash hit! Umihara Kawase is the name of our backpacking, Japanese, sushi chef heroine armed with a fishing rod, elastic fishing line, and a fishing hook. Face fish-like enemies, conveyor belts, spikes, watery pits, time travel and more. Collect items, and find your way to the end of each level. The deeper into this dream-like world that you venture, the more challenging the solutions and the greater the time pressure becomes.

The elasticity of UmiharaÃ‚Æ’??s fishing line sets the Umihara Kawase Trilogy apart from other games, giving unprecedented levels of mobility and discovery. Tightening the line or giving lots of slack can be the difference between success or failure. The elastic nature of the fishing line allows the player to stretch down to otherwise unreachable areas or be catapulted upwards. Trilogy Features Physics-based puzzle/platforming that challenges your reflexes and brainpower Extreme elastic fishing-line physics give you advanced control Many stages with branching paths across three complete games Steam Workshop support in all three games for sharing replays Four playable characters (in Sayonara Umihara Kawase) Face giant, aquatic bosses like a tadpole, a seahorse, and more Steam Achievements, Trading Cards, Leaderboards, and Cloud Saving Full Steam controller support for all three games (optional)"

Who will manage to do something about it? Maybe Rinka? Well, Wiseghaika surely hopes that somebody will do something. Some fairies managed to learn how to use them as a weapon, so fights will be less painful. But not all of them have mastered this art. To be exact - neither of our six heroes can use those mysterious stones in big barrages. This... might give you some problems. But c'mon, since when were heroes stronger that their foes? (Please, don't say it in front of Skootis.) Back to gems! Weird thing about them - when two of the same color collide, they go 'ding' and release some weird spheres. Those spheres can absorb other gems! Red spheres, for example, absorb all red gems, they meet, but will stop after absorbing any gem that isn't red. The same happens with others, mostly-maybe! ('^' ) If gems will touch left side of your screen, you'll get hurt! Does it makes sense? What are 'screens'? I heard abut them from Astro-fairies, but now they are extinct, so I can't ask them. Gray gems are different and weird! They won't hurt you and most likely will disappear after touching that weird shield in front of you. It is almost like they're devoid of energy. But you shouldn't take them too easy - You can't destroy them as there are no gray gems in your arsenal, so, only way is either to wait while they will be destroyed by the barrier, or make some sphere touch them. =about the Game Itself= This game is made in the vein of old puzzle-like games, without real twist. Just simple active puzzle.Or maybe there is some twist? For the first game made with this engine I think it is good job from my side, considering, that everything except music is made by sole silly me. Now, there is a couple known bugs that can occur, but won't destroy game too much, or maybe they are finally gone - couldn't get them last beta-testing session. Game just... likes to be important to you, so please remember to put it on a pause, if you suddenly need to do something else, while playing. ('^' ) Please, tell us about bugs, we'll be trying to fix them. Remember to save settings in OPTIONS, or else when you restart the game they'll go back to standard ones.

The main feature of the game is the unpredictable behavior of the players on the pitch. However, you should keep in mind that not only the opponent teamÃ‚Æ’??s players are going to faff around but your own as well, because their main task is not to score a goal but just to kick the ball as strong as they can, and they do not really bother where it is going to fly then. Besides, sometimes the players do not scruple to hit one another, and you can act in the same way too. And if you neutralize the opponent's player, their team will become weaker so you will have more chances to win. The main objective is to score 15 goals to win the match. You can use any kind of dirty tricks, for there are no rules in this game."

It's all bruken! Everything's bruken! The world's bruken! Gravity is bruken! Goodness gracious me!'. :) Explore this exciting new world as a little ball. I do believe that whatever caused this place to break apart like this has left lots of energy around the place. I wonder if that'll help you to overcome the ever stronger gravitational force as you get closer to the center! Hmm! Either way, it's just a bit of fun! Have an explore, do the jumps, poke around the maze (or on top of the maze!) and generally just enjoy yourself. I made this game with one goal in mind. A relaxing and fun game to play when you're keen to chill out in the afternoon (or whenever you relax really) with a bit of difficulty at the end/middle. Good luck with that by the way, gravity can be a real pain in the butt! Features: - A big ol' hand crafted world to explore (not just procedural planes....) - All sorts of things to jump on/off/over/into/etc. - A movement system with slight complexity to it (if you figure it out, there are a few different ways to do things). - Energy system (the more you have, the better/faster/stronger na na na na what don't kill me, can only make me stronger, wait, what was I saying?) - Plenty of waypoints etc. - Fun, excitement, joy, bliss, the meaning of life, candy, a brand new Porche 911 2018 model with turbo chargers AND superchargers, hand crafted by angels and painted by famous artists long dead. - Alright that last one may have been a stretch but... sales, amirite?"

Meeple Station is an isometric pixel-art space station building and management sim that takes inspiration from games in the vein of Dwarf Fortress and Rimworld. Build a space station up from bare-bone essentials and a skeleton crew, into a bustling metropolis of activity filled with so many Meeple you'll probably forget about a few of them. You picked a great time to hop on board as we're just dropping our major Planets Update just now, which will have your Meeple expanding across the solar system. It's in an early state, but it's the foundation for a summer full of huge feature releases we've been working on and are very excited to share with you! The big recent changes we've added are also part of the bedrock of what is to come. Heee! Meeple need things to live! Ice can be melted and turned into Oxygen, which assuredly your Meeple will need to continue breathing. They also seem to like regular access to food! Make sure they have bathrooms near or you're going to end up with one stinky station. Use Meeple for jobs they are well suited to and house them in decent surroundings or the icy fingers of unhappiness will take hold. Just wait until you see the damage an unhappy officer can cause! Once you make your station a nice productive place to live, it's prestige will spread and draw new Meeple to the station and necessitate expansion. Expansion requires more resources, so get to mining! Meeple Station boasts a robust Z-layer system that is seemingly uncommon in many isometric and management games. The system allows up to 32 vertical floors- so stations can get quite gigantic if you so desire. Trade! At first, you can get things you need from traders, that you can't effectively manufacture on your own. Once you have a good operation going you can turn the tables and make quite a profit from supplying refined resources and manufactured goods to traders based on their needs. With the Planets Update, we've added the very beginnings of the Player-owned ships system, which we plan to expand on quite a bit in upcoming patches. Assign Pilots to ships and fly construction crews to build new stations. That's right! Multiple stations are new to the Planets patch as well! Now that you can travel around the solar system, you're going to be able to build multiple concurrent stations around different planets. Fight off lazy pirates! Pirates gonna pirate. Maybe they did bad in school and space is hard? Whatever the reason, they want your stuff. That's waaaay easier than doing work themselves. Make sure you have guard Meeple to fight them when they come. Station shields and turrets work wonders against bombers. We have so many big things in store for the near future that we hope will floor you with their scope. It's a very exciting time over here in the dev team. We work tirelessly to try to get them in your hands as soon as humanly possible, because we're over-excited children and this is our little passion project we can't wait to share with our community. Eventually, we plan on an inter-station ship-based trading, cargo, mining, and exploration network. It's ambitious, but we really can't wait to show you what we've been tossing into the stew for the future! Seriously, we sit up at night just playing with pixel planets and little tiny shippies. It's a problem. Speaking of community, drop into our Discord and say hello! We love to hear from you all!"

How does Thermo Sudoku work? Well each sudoku grid contains thermometer shapes (often drawn to create themes) and digits on thermometers must increase as one moves further from the bulb end. The interactions between the thermometers leads to new logical ideas and patterns that completely refreshes the standard sudoku solving experience. As with their other games (Ã‚Æ’??Classic SudokuÃ‚Æ’??, Ã‚Æ’??Sandwich SudokuÃ‚Æ’?? and Ã‚Æ’??Chess SudokuÃ‚Æ’??), Simon Anthony and Mark Goodliffe (the hosts of Cracking The Cryptic) have personally crafted the hints for the puzzles. So you know that every puzzle has been play-tested by a human being to ensure that the sudoku is interesting and fun to solve. In Cracking The CrypticÃ‚Æ’??s games, players start with zero stars and earn stars by solving puzzles. The more puzzles you solve, the more stars you earn and the more puzzles you get to play. Only the most dedicated (and cleverest) sudoku players will finish all the puzzles. Of course the difficulty is carefully calibrated to ensure lots of puzzles at every level (from easy through to extreme). Anyone familiar with their YouTube channel will know that Simon and Mark take pride in teaching viewers to be better solvers and, in these games, they always craft the puzzles with the mindset of trying to help solvers improve their skills. Mark and Simon have both represented the UK many times at the World Sudoku Championship and you can find more of their puzzles (and lots of others) on the internetÃ‚Æ’??s biggest sudoku channel Cracking The Cryptic. Features: 40 beautiful puzzles on launch 100 puzzles in all with regular updates to reach this total in the first year post launch. Hints crafted by Simon and Mark!"

So currently in the game you can play a set of 4 interactive Tutorials and 4 Training Missions, but there is still much more content to be added before 5.0 and listed below you will see the content still to come. Mission packs 1 and 2 also currently each give you 3 full missions of the Siberian Dawn story. - A set of Missions comparable to the Missions in the Mission Packs, set before the Siberian Dawn story - Skirmish mode with the new content of the Base game, DLC will then add extra content to this mode - Crisis mode with the new content of the Base game, DLC will then add extra content to this mode - Ark section that will contain various unlocks and uncover the secrets of Siberian Dawn This game is a strategic card based wargame with deckbuilding elements and the detailed tutorials will take you through how to play the game. As it was built to be a game that offered a lot of strategic options during a mission it is not a simple deckbuilder but is a game that requires thought and a bit of time to learn its mechanics. Overview Siberian Dawn is an original, solo, digital card game that combines the core soul of a deck builder with the tactical power of a war game and the strategic challenge of crisis management. You are an Overseer in the Union, one of the tactical controllers who has to deal with the increasing dangers facing the Union through Objective based Missions. Recruit and deploy Units, enlist the help of the Guilds, and build your Bond with those in the shadows, whilst trying to control the conflict unfolding before you. The base game contains a detailed series of interactive tutorials and 4 Training Mission that will teach you how to play the game, and the Mission Packs available as DLC each add 3 new Missions of the Siberian Dawn story. The World In Siberian Dawn you play the part of an Overseer in the Union, an industrial state covering what we know as Europe. Overseers are the tactical experts of the Union and responsible for quickly dealing with troubles as they arise using a limited resource pool, controlled squad level force, and possible support from the Guilds. Siberian Dawn has a heavy character driven setting, in a gritty near future military world that mixes in medieval and supernatural horror elements to the theme. The game starts as hostility has been growing in Industrial Habit IH-54 of the Eastern Zones for the last few weeks. Outcasts are rumoured to have been stirring up this dissent and it is believed they are connected to a cult called the Dawn, Overseers have been assigned to deal with this unrest and you are one of them. Each Mission will give the Overseer a series of Objectives to complete which have variety and offer the Overseer different challenges during the Mission. Missions will be playable individually but also form a narrative story as the Overseer uncovers the truth of the Dawn and how deep secrets go within the Union and Guilds. Mission Example An example Training mission in the base game is First Run, which is aimed to give you a taste of Siberian Dawn and the basics of a Mission. The Objectives in this Mission will take you through the steps towards the final Objective to kill the 4 VBots, the Missions in Mission Pack 1 and those to follow will contain multiple Objectives offering a longer more challenging game. First Run also contains 2 Units, the Grunt and the Scribe. The Grunt is your basic Union military Unit that will be used to attack the VBots, and the Scribe is a Guild support Unit who will help you gain Glory. Full Missions add 18 new Units to these 2 basic ones. Lore Engine Siberian Dawn is the first game to use the Lore Deck Building Engine, taking the core of a Deck Builder and adding the depth of a War Game to give the player a more strategic challenge. Dual Deck Development Ã‚Æ’?? Build a Resource deck and Tactics deck. Bond System Ã‚Æ’?? Adds 1 of 4 Guild specific contacts in a Mission (Available with Mission Pack 1) Hub System Ã‚Æ’??

Fishticuffs,2020-12-21,0.0,4.99,nan,,,,nan,nan,"Fishticuffs is a bullet hell fishing roguelite. You cast your hook into the ocean in order to harvest fish and treasure. But the fish are not bassic creatures, they will not be harvested withtrout putting up a fight. As a wise man once said: 'The best defense is a lot of bullets'. Looking at the behaviour of the fish, they seem to have writ this quote into the very bedrock of their culture, if their determination to krill you is any indication. Whale you descend through each level you have the opportunity to swell your coffers like a pufferfish, by grabbing treasure and harvesting fish. But of course this must be considered against the risk of damage that may be inherent to attacking these aquatic adversaries and seeking these submurged shinies. Maybe it is best to battle anemone for monetary reward. Or perhaps it is a difficult situation beyond your equipment that you should not fall for: hook, line or sinker. Among the underwater world are items for you to find and wield. Some of them you will find offered up to you for free on a silver platter as though you're not a fisherman but a nobleman in an esteemed restaurant. Others will require payment, for there are some in this world who understand that everything is worth some fee. As your skill waxes you will find ways to coral ever more items into your item purse, amassing an uncodly amount of power. If your hook is slain, the voyage begins anew, with nothing taken from one run to the next other than your own expertise and knowledge. Your mind attunad to the ways of the game, learning how to maximise your power and wealth via items, how to skate around the bullets of the fish to stay unharmed. Different enemy patterns and items will appear on each run, so your ability to improvise will be tried. Some of these items are simplistic such as shark blades that grant you more damage, and a wrench that repairs your hook. Others are more complex like a parasite that causes some fish to explode into homing fisshiles, and a 'gun bender' that causes fish to sometimes accidentally shoot themselves. Most items will stack if you collect more than one, so hoarding fifty knives will kill most fish in one hit, and fifty gun benders will almost guarantee fish to self-shoot. To start a run from death takes mere seconds. You may die, and before you know it you'll be able to clam an item on the next run and be bonking fish left right and centre. In only a few minutes you'll know the flavour of the run: Whether it is characterised by an abundance of friendly fisshiles blowfishing up everything within line of sight"

The Dodger must sabotage the game board using a plethora of items and abilities, and dodge their way around pieces when the Dropper manages to create a line.

But be careful there are many like you, they and various viruses will get in your way. Unique Mechanics In the world of Project Reborn things are not arranged as usual, here the more DNA you have, the less time you need to grab the Egg Cell, as DNA and ability capsules drop off from everything, this opens up a huge range of actions. Some will choose to collect matter spheres or complete tasks, some will hunt down other players trying to get their DNA and ability capsules to sell at auction, and some will choose to destroy viruses. Some will capture Megaspheres or search for drone boxes and in the end you will fight for the Egg Cell. Thousands of ability combinations You don't need to level up your character to unlock all of the ability capsules, from strengthening you and your resistance to powers such as invisibility and speed. All of them are of different ranks from ordinary to legendary. You just have to get them or buy them at Auction from other players like yourself. You can combine them and even strengthen them getting a unique class character that suits you! If you want to experiment and find the right combination you can simply change the capsules with abilities. PVP and PVE zones There are 3 different play zones Safe Zone - a small zone at the edges of the world where you are spawned and where you can't get hurt. Development Zone (PVE) - most viruses are here, in this zone you can not be destroyed by other players, together you can hunt tumors. Battle Zone - it is in the middle of the map, where players can fight against each other. Before going to this zone you should carefully select the right capsules with abilities, as the zone in the inventory will be available only the main 10 cells and access to the auction will be closed. Auction All players have the right to sell and buy any capsules and drones in the auction, with a variety of filters you can find the item you need. That would sell the auction simply move the cursor on your item and in the description of the item click on the button 'sellÃ‚Æ’?Ã‚Â and stating the price. Viruses There are several types of viruses in the game. Flu are the most common, they're just as likely to attach themselves to the suit and tear it to shreds. Luckily they don't pose much of a threat on their own. Tumors - These are the evils that constantly proliferate in the body. There are three kinds of them, toxic, electric and frozen. They are large slow but strong and each species produces 2 small tumors every minute, some small tumors can heal their creator giving their life in return. If you attack their mother they will sense this and rush to defend her even at the end of the world. So the sooner you team up and destroy the tumors the better, before they spread all over your body. Adenovirus is a rare virus that wanders through the organism at high speed, it's not dangerous if you don't attack it yourself. If it takes damage it will release deadly spikes. But if you can catch up to it and destroy it, you'll be well rewarded. HIV - Human Immunodeficiency Virus, the main and most dangerous virus, it is alone, but can harm and destroy the android body so it must be destroyed before the Egg is captured. It has a huge amount of life and can severely cripple you if touched, also beware of its projectiles they burn through the suit. As his life dwindles he goes crazy and begins to frantically rush from side to side sweeping away everything in his path, try to dodge it. After his death everyone who caused damage and stayed in the game until the end of the capture eggs share the reward commensurate with the damage caused. Optimal monetization Absolutely all in-game items and costumes can be purchased for in-game currency, you only need to accumulate the required amount of in-game premium money - Zions, which in most cases can be earned by capturing Egg Cells or completing assignments. Note that in the auction items are sold and bought for another non-premium and easier to obtain currency - Ions. Costumes There are a lot of costumes (skins) in the game you can transform your sperm cell in a suit that suits you best, whether it be an astronaut suit or a pirate costume. We are constantly adding new costumes. Drones Sometimes on the map there are boxes with drones, be careful and when you find one you will be able to open and get a drone comparable to the rank of your found box. Each of the 4 levels of box has its own time to capture, the higher the level the longer you need to hold the box. You can move during this time, run and fight, but all players will know that you picked up the drone box. Drones always stay with you, even if you're killed, they help you, for example the drone 'Scanotron 3000' scans your enemies determining what kind of capsules they have (unless of course the enemy has an Ã‚Æ’??AntiscanÃ‚Æ’?Ã‚Â capsule of the proper level) or the drone 'Mechanic' which repairs the suit. We are constantly improving the game, adding all new capsules, viruses, drones, modes, and more."

Like the best tabletop roleplaying experiences, Wildermyth gives you choices and answers your every decision with consequences that drive your characters forward. Lead a band of heroes as they grow from reluctant farmers into unique, legendary fighters. Combat unexpected threats and strange monsters across interactive battlefields. Unravel mysteries and share pensive moments in an ever-new fantasy setting that blends hard truths and sacrifice with humor and personal storytelling. Where does your myth lead? Come help us uncover it! Reminiscent of tabletop roleplaying, unique heroes are born in unique settings every game. They age, transform, fall in love, disagree, and make harrowing sacrifices. Each hero brings their own organic history and personality with them, but your choices and combat skills are what decide their paths and outcomes. All heroes die somedayÃ‚Æ’?ÃƒÂ but you get to hold on to your favorites. Reintroduce them in the next adventure, and over many lifetimes the myths you make will form your own legendary pantheon. An Imaginative Papercraft World The Yondering Lands, where the game is set, is a richly layered world populated with hand-painted 2D characters and scenery. WeÃ‚Æ’??ve paid loving attention to breaking molds and exploring new ideas: no orcs, elves, or goblins hereÃ‚Æ’??but watch out for the telepathic insect-dragons and the clockwork undead. Extreme Character Depth Each of your heroes has their own unique generated history, personality, and appearance, and will form relationships with your other heroes. All of these elements change and develop over the course of a playthrough, as characters age, encounter mysteries, and overcome challenges. Choices That Matter Your hero may choose to trust the enigmatic wolf god, leading to a hair-raising change in their appearance and combat abilities. Or they may pursue a romance with a fellow hero, giving each of them a shared buff and more story opportunities. Encounters and events have permanent, character-defining effects, letting you craft the arc of each character. A New Approach to Death Did your favorite character get one-shotted by a tentacled horror-bear? Choose to let a hero 'fall back' with a maiming that will lead to some transformative new paths in their legend, or let them go out in a blaze of glory to be remembered for generations to come. Deep and Creative Tactical Combat Combat in Wildermyth emphasizes teamwork and careful positioning, as well as imaginative use of your evolving capabilities and surroundings. Walling and Flanking mechanics provide clear but conflicting incentives, while mystical interfusion lets you remake the battlefield with explosive magic. Multiple difficulty levels mean you can get as intense as you want to. Cooperative Multiplayer In a multiplayer game, you and your friends can each customize and control your own heroes as you play through a campaign. Recommended for up to five playersÃ‚Æ’??though in a typical campaign, you start with three heroes and pick up the fourth and fifth along the way. We also support Steam Remote Play. Endless Replayability Pick and choose from a huge bank of combat abilities as your heroes level up in each playthrough, and decide whether you prefer offensive or defensive tactics, brute strength, stealth, or magically flinging fire from a nearby lamp into your enemies' faces. Procedural generation gives you new heroes, new enemies, new story events, and new maps every time you play. A Custom Pantheon of Legends YouÃ‚Æ’??ll have the freedom to customize hero appearances, names, histories, and more. As time passes, heroes grow old and may retire, or else might fall in combatÃ‚Æ’??and yes, some will survive all the way to the end. You can add your favorite heroes to a roster of legends and call on them again in later playthroughs. Build your own mythologies and share the awe-inspiring might of your heroes with others."

This time around Meat Boy is always running, like literally...it's an auto-runner . He can't stop and he won't stop. Levels are brutal, death is inevitable, and players will get that sweet feeling of accomplishment after beating a level. Players will run, jump, punch and kick their way through familiar settings and totally new worlds. WhatÃ‚Æ’??s better than playing through Super Meat Boy Forever once? The answer is simple: Playing through Super Meat Boy Forever several times and having new levels to play each time. We created over 6000 level chunks and smash them together to create new unique levels and each time the game is completed the option to replay the game appears and generates a whole new experience by presenting different levels with their own unique secret locations. WeÃ‚Æ’??ve handcrafted literally thousands of levels for players to enjoy and conquer. You can replay Super Meat Boy Forever from start to finish several times before ever seeing a duplicate level. It is truly a remarkable feat of engineering and a monumental example of ignoring the limits of rational game design and production. Super Meat Boy Forever takes place a few years after the events of Super Meat Boy. Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have been living a happy life free of Dr. Fetus for several years and they now have a wonderful little baby named Nugget. Nugget is joy personified and she is everything to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl. One day while our heroes were on a picnic, Dr. Fetus snuck up on them, beat Meat Boy and Bandage Girl unconscious with a shovel and kidnapped Nugget! When our heroes came to and found that Nugget was missing, they knew who to go after. They cracked their knuckles and decided to never stop until they got Nugget back and taught Dr. Fetus a very important lesson. A lesson that can only be taught with punches and kicks."

All games are uniquely tailored to underline the story and the mood of the game. Meet the people who told the original stories We value the importance of storytellers, those who carry the tales of others and share them. That's why, in Elk, you will also meet the living storytellers who inspired us to make this game. How we used true stories in the game? True stories? how to use a true story in an ethical way? This is how we have dealt with it in Welcome to Elk: The stories in Welcome to Elk, are told by the people who we know and/or were there when the events took place. All are told from memory. The way they are used both on our webpage and in the game is true to the core story but everything like names, locations and other details are changed, renamed and often re-framed to protect the real people behind them, therefore, we call them tall tales. The stories are not one to one like you would experience in true crime for example. They are rewritten and combined to one linear narrative. Characters may play a role in one story where they where not a part of originally and only us who designed it will ever know Ã‚Æ’?? or come close to the real truth of the stories. Welcome to Elk might look like a Ã‚Æ’??funÃ‚Æ’?Ã‚Â game but itÃ‚Æ’??s about telling stories Ã‚Æ’?? some are filled with humour others are dark, but they go hand in hand."

There lived a swordsman who was given five swords forged by god himself. Using these swords, the swordsman brought peace and order to the world. People called the swordsman, 'Wielder of the Five Swords'... One day, during a fete to praise the gods, the blades of the swordsman turn against the gods for reasons unknown. One of the gods, Ozone, furious with all his powers, sealed the swordsman away at the top of a mountain now known as Swords Peak. This tale begins 5,000 years after the battle between the two, near a the small village of Cardina. -Game Overview- Seamless open-world game mechanics While the game features a rather old school Ã‚Æ’??quarter viewÃ‚Æ’?Ã‚Â mechanic, the map transitions and event scenes, even the combat is all seamless as can be to enhance the overall gaming experience. Real time strategic action battle system Utilizing 2 primary attack buttons, users can assign different weapons to each button to create a unique combo that fits the users need as they go. Monsters, bosses and stage gimmicks can require a specific type of weapon at times creating opportunities for users to strategize their best route of approach. Customizable Tattoo system Utilizing 'tattoos', users are given specific points upon leveling to get the protagonist inked as a form of powering up so it could be built to oneÃ‚Æ’??s own.

What does 'filter-focused' photo editing mean? It means that CameraBag Photo has the advanced tools you need to make your images look just how you want, but in an interface that makes it incredibly easy to re-use the styles you develop as custom filters. Or to start with existing presets to emulate classic film stock, or to batch apply the same style to hundreds of photos. It means that CameraBag is built from top to bottom to help you develop a unique photographic style that is distinctly your own. WeÃ‚Æ’??ve designed CameraBag Photo to sit in the sweet spot of photo software: itÃ‚Æ’??s much more versatile and powerful than cheesy Ã‚Æ’??one-clickÃ‚Æ’?Ã‚Â filter apps, but much lighter, quicker, and more intuitive than bloated traditional Ã‚Æ’??proÃ‚Æ’?Ã‚Â photo software. CameraBag's interface is focused on building up a series of image adjustments (or loading existing filters made up of a series of adjustments) and tweaking them as needed. You can easily see every adjustment you've applied to your image in the bottom tray, adjust their controls, reorder or delete them, or save what you've got as a new filter. Key Features - 150+ built-in high-quality adjustable filters - Full suite of 30+ photographic tools, including advanced curve editors - Build your own entirely new filters from scratch or from existing filters - Elegant, modern interface - Innovative tools not found anywhere else, such as CameraBag's curve-based color corrector - Fast image processing via the revolutionary Analog Engine - 32-bits-per-component color depth - Entirely non-destructive editing process - Easy layering of filters and adjustments - Quicklooks and previews for fast decision making - Watermarking and custom image-based borders - Batch processing - RAW format support CameraBag Photo is the newest version of CameraBag (the previous major release was called CameraBag 2, so this is technically version 3). We've added a whole bunch of cool stuff, here are some of the major things: - Masking - 4-Way color wheels - Multi-document tabs - Live pixel inspector - Animated hover previews - Dynamic preview chooser - Collapsible tool and filter sections - Updated look - Color management - Render queue - Speed improvements - Dozens of new filters You can start or finish with over 150 fully-editable included presets, to which you can add an infinite number of your own. From classic film stock emulation to color correction setups to versatile color and B+W styles, CameraBag Photo has you covered. Here are some of the filter groups included: - B+W Essentials - Classic Photography - Color Essentials - Color Correction - Film Grain - Film Stock - Filtered B+W - Mattes - Monocolor - Vintage - And More..."

Everything takes a turn when Ava finds out what Mila is actually hiding in her panties.

The place was walking distance from the city center, so Mila didnÃ‚Æ’??t think long and moved in with her immediately after she saw the offer online. The price seemed very good, but having a roommate as attractive as Ava was definitely the deciding factor for Mila. The girls got to know each other very easily, although they were very shy at first.

It was built by CrossComm in partnership with the Greensboro History Museum for the museumÃ‚Æ’??s Project Democracy 20/20 exhibition. Gerrymander Madness is not backed by a political party, nor is it intended to support one party over another. In fact, both the Democratic and Republican parties have used gerrymandering to their advantage, both in North Carolina and in other areas of the country.

At least, that's what the brochure said. The reality is closer to a non-stop partying, drinking, fucking and whatever else those hyper-hormonized barely adults can wrap their tiny attention spans around. Melissa was one said barely-adult college-goers. She was part of one of the biggest sororities on campus, which only meant one thing: she partied till the sun came up, drank like a fish, and had the wildest sex she could whenever she didin't black-out from near alcohol poisoning... which was most of the time. This continued for her entire four-year tenancy on campus and Melissa soaked in every moment of it. But with her parents picking up the tab and seeing her grades dip lower and lower and with her not having even picked a major, they felt like enough was enough and, with one phone call, they laid out the ultimatum. And there Melissa was: one semester left in her senior year on the the razor's edge of passing or failing and with no financial support of any kind from her folks. And something maybe even more crucial laid on the horizon: her duties as a Senior Sister from her sorority (not actually crucial... except that the sorority was her last lifeline after removing daddy deariest's wallet). Ã‚Æ’??As much as Rebecca and I have been known to go at each other's throats, it's Emma Grey's that I would like to slit. She and Rebecca are from the same rival sorority house and, if you thought Rebecca's psycho bitch impression was believable, then Emma is the actual inspiration for the faÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂµade. Heartless, cold and a true bitch by nature - the imitation pales before the original...Ã‚Æ’?Ã‚Â WHAT CAN I DO HERE? Change Melissa's attitude and help her pass all her exams to graduate Focus on your sorority duties, win the bet and punish your rivals Start your career as a webcam girl and perform naughty shows for money Seduce your exotic roommate and teach her how to make love to a woman Parties, pranks, sex - live your life and become the slut you always wanted to be COMPLETE EDITION For the first time, play the game with both expansions already included to make your college experience feel genuinely complete! Teacher's Secrets Expansion new job at school that allows you to pose naked for an art class for the money. ask your history teacher, Miss Defolio, if you could perform a sexy photoshoot in exchange for a small increase in your grade. ask your Science teacher, Miss Heard, if you could be her little sex slave for a day if she would consider raising your rank in her class. discover your rival's little secret and torment the ring leader in hopes to exact revenge on them for years of humiliation. an additional cheat menu that allows you to bosst your stats at the start of a new playthrough. Extra Credit Expansion new job at school that allows you to be a dinner companion to an older gentleman or do a sexy striptease for frat party in exchange for money. new sorority missions for you and your fellow Alpha Beta's to perform. ask your Business Teacher, Mr. Felix, if he'd let you fool around with you in public in order to get a small boost in your grade. ask your Math Teacher, Mr. Patron, if you'd be his little living doll for him to admire in exchange for a better grade in his class. finally, get your revenge and some ultimate payback on Emma Grey in one of two humiliating ways! go on several dates with characters to places ranging from the beach to the bar. meet and befriend the new foreign exchange student from Italy, Tony Ricci. expanded scenes from the original game ABOUT GAMEPLAY PLEDGE is a relationship simulator where you manage your time in order to not only boost your personal stats but also interact with other characters.

Vengeful Rites aims to change that by bringing a proper adventure to VR. Your journey through the game will take you across different locales and dungeons as you fend off vicious enemies, search for hidden treasures, solve a variety of puzzles, defeat epic bosses and more. You'll use swords, bows, magic and your wits to overcome the many challenges that await. You'll master new techniques, improve your stats and skills, learn new spells and upgrade your gear with purchased, found and crafted weapons and rings. Your journey to the Otherworld will be fraught with peril from the beginning, but with the myriad tools at your disposal, you'll have all you need to dispatch your would-be dispatchers. Adventure awaits! The Story The Serafin Brotherhood has stood as a shield to protect mankind from the likes of goblins and monsters since time immemorial, but its days of glory are long behind it. When Dragore, a disgraced member returns to slay your mentor, you're left as the final Serafin and the only one who can avenge your fallen master while putting an end to Dragore's plan to overrun the world with Others. The Combat As a Serafin, you're not limited to a single means of dealing with your enemies. You've got swords, bows and magic all available to you to use as you see fit. Swords Waggle to win doesn't exist in Vengeful Rites. Sword strikes require you to swing like you mean it, and enemies won't roll over without a fight. Sword fights require you to constantly shift between defending yourself with well timed parries and taking your opportunities to land strikes when you can. Magic As a Serafin, you're capable of conjuring magic directly into your hands. By mastering the different disciplines of magic: Destruction, Protection, Restoration and Kinesis, you can handle anything Dragore and his minions throw at you. With intuitive gestures and multiple spells in each discipline, conjuring magic has never felt more natural and reactive. Archery Bows can be the deadliest tool in your arsenal, but they require the most skill. With a well placed headshot, especially if you find your arrow on fire, you can deal huge amounts of damage to any unsuspecting enemies you might encounter. Your wits are your best weapon! All throughout your adventure you'll come across obstacles that can't be overcome with brute force alone. You'll need to figure out how to solve puzzles, bypass obstacles and capitalize on the vulnerabilities of the many bosses you'll encounter. The Customization Throughout your journey you'll unlock perks to specialize in the different disciplines of combat. Classes are not a thing in Vengeful Rites, and while you'll be expected to use all the tools given to you, having a focus on swords, bows or magic will help you handle the many challenges you'll face with more of an emphasis on your preferred playstyle. With enough specialization, you can unlock devastating abilities to take full advantage of your chosen focus--like powerful two handed spells or the ability to imbue your arrows with magic! Equipment plays a role, too! Meteor shards can be used to enchant swords with useful abilities like lifesteal or lightning. Scepters can be substituted for swords for the more magically inclined to have some additional ranged attacks and better mana management. Crafted rings give options to refine certain abilities or modify how you handle different situations. Difficulty settings will keep things as straightforward or as challenging as you like and can be changed on the fly as necessary. Basically what I'm saying is that replayability is a thing. Join the conversation! It's not all doom and gloom. You'll encounter a few friendly faces in your travels, as well. They're all fully voiced, and with voice recognition you can speak back to them for extra immersion. Smooth/Teleportation locomotion supported. Vengeful Rites has been improved so much by our close communication with players.

Gizmo is a Saturday-morning 3D platformer inspired by 90s classics of the genre.

The only problem is that this has taken a long time and he ought to be stopped. Earth is now one huge construction site built by Dr Bolt's population of robots!

You can either take your time and finish the level normally or you can collect all the hidden beacons, kill all the enemies and smash all the barrels.

Fully customizable controls so you can play how best suits you. 3 Achievements! -------------------- There is so much we wanted to do with Gizmo. We love the old platformers from the 90s and felt there weren't many new ones that captured the same feeling. We didn't want an open world, we wanted designed, structured levels with clear progression. It turns out it's too much work for us to do on our own, but rather than wasting the project away we decided to clean up what he had and put it on Steam! We believe this is only a slice of a larger game. We want a full platforming game! 25+ levels, different themes set all around the world exploring Dr Bolt's bizarre version of Earth. When developing this concept level, we dreamt up the larger picture first to give the game more depth and direction. This example level stands alone, but presents a lot of the ideas about the characters and setting that belong in a larger game.

We wanted the game to have an immersive story and the first half of it to be a circle-tower-defense-game, meaning that the monsters will not vanish in a portal of some sort, but stay on the screen until you have destroyed them, or there are 100 of them on the screen (in which case you have lost). But other than that, no bells and whistles, just basic action, but neatly balanced, good controls and not too easy. The games controls are RTS-like (that means, that you control a hero, who will do most of the work in-game) and the second half of the levels will change the gameplay to a standard tower-defense game.

Only a part of the planned story and content is in the game. We still think it's a cool experience worth trying out though! Mind Diver is a first-person detective game. You search a woman's memories for clues to solving the mystery of what happened to her boyfriend after a party. As a Mind Diver you explore an ocean of memories. Use your logical deduction skills to fill out holes in memories to restore them. Mind DiverÃ‚Æ’??s unique investigation and deduction structure is developed in consultation with world-leaders in puzzle design, like Lucas Pope , creator of Return of the Obra Dinn . You will come across lots of unexpected discoveries and exploration of a fascinating mind world, with surprising deductions. In Mind Diver, the story is the puzzle. Only by understanding the story can you progress. Fresh, expressive 3D-scan style The style creates an authentic experience, packed with details to study and explore. Paying close attention to detail helps you solve puzzles and brings you closer to the characters of the game. Glimpses into a beautiful relationship The memories float around in larger-than-life surreal landscapes, each centered around an emotion: Heartbreak, Worry, Hope, Regret and more. Every solution to a memory reveals not only more of the story, but also more clues to the overarching mystery that you are trying to solve. Mind Diver will make you feel like an actual detective by only giving you the clues and asking you to make the connection. Pleasing and satisfying correction mechanic Memories are restored by using your logical deduction skill to fill out empty holes in memories. You can pick up anything, even people from the memory or a nearby memory and fill out black memory holes to uncover suppressed secrets. Explore the mind world and think ahead to make the correct decision. Satisfying, rhythmic swimming As a Mind Diver you can freely swim around the landscapes to explore the mind. With the implementation of a satisfying, rhythmic swimming mechanic you are in control of your swim speed. Helpful transportation slipstream The slipstream connects you between multiple memories. The mind world offers an intriguing case, involving disappearances and deception, with a universal truth at the heart of the story. Getting to the bottom of the case is not easy, so you'll feel like a genius detective as you solve satisfying, challenging puzzles. Easy navigation through memory portals You will come across a striking world and scan-visuals that evoke a unique feeling of reality. Memory portals will connect you between areas and ensure a simple, smooth travel between the clues you need to make each deduction. Amazing atmosphere As you explore the mind and work to solve the puzzles, the game atmosphere and soundtrack weave together to create a larger-than-life, melancholic atmosphere.

Each of the rooms (gym, laboratory, scrapper) can be expanded, which will bring you new bonuses! Catch pests The tasks are different: sometimes itÃ‚Æ’??s a simple neutralization, sometimes you have to catch a living animal, but each pest requires a different approach.

You play as our young amnesiac hero, who woke up from a year-long coma into an unknown world. He remembers nothing and recognizes no-one from his former life. What happened to him? ThatÃ‚Æ’??s for you to find out. The game is populated by a variety of characters, each with their own distinct personality, background and secrets. Special attention and care is put into the quality of the images and animations.

A variety of fetishes Task log Phone Achievements Secrets and easter eggs WHATÃ‚Æ’??S COMING: This is how I want the game to look. It is a Free Roam title, with each character having their own schedule and story. The main storyline develops along with the protagonist's relationship to the main characters: Alexandra, Kate and Elena. The basic outline of these relations is a system of 6 levels, with each increasing level allowing for new interactions in Free Roam. As the main plot develops, the player character will encounter secondary characters (girls). IÃ‚Æ’??ve already written about 10 of these secondary girls, but the idea is to bring this number up into the dozens, with each girl having their own plot and relationship levels (from 0 to 5): each level will bring up hotter and hotter encounters. EARLY ACCESS: Ã‚Æ’??Early accessÃ‚Æ’?Ã‚Â means that you can start playing right now, but youÃ‚Æ’??ll find that some of the gameÃ‚Æ’??s features are still to be fully developed. For example, IÃ‚Æ’??m planning to introduce various mini-games which will help in upgrading the player character and advancing the plot. The game features voice acting, but itÃ‚Æ’??s still a ways to go from the level of professionalism that IÃ‚Æ’??d like for each of the animations. I would also like to introduce skills for the main character which will weigh-in on his interactions and make branched scenes according to each playerÃ‚Æ’??s particular dialogue choices. Finally, I want to take the post-processing of images and animations to the next level. For this, I will probably need to get a powerful workstation, in order to produce higher resolution images and 60fps animations: all for the sake of perfection! I also plan to fully develop the plot beats and interactions of supporting characters, but only after the main storyline is finished."

Sadly, this almost immediately leads to his death at the hands of a mysterious swordsman seemingly displaced in time...but death is to be only the beginning of his adventure.

This ends either when the controlled enemy dies, or you start controlling another enemy (you can control just one at a time).

Careful though, now there are 2 players who can mess up a puzzle or get killed by a deadly trap! The main way to deal with Sam's foes is by using magic. Aside from the basic projectile, there is a number of spells to learn. Spells consume mana, so you should keep an eye on that blue bar.

The so-called gods who championed our sector have been dealt a terrible blow. They cannot protect us any longer. Now again as in ages past the conflict spirals towards Earth. Once more our world is about to become the front line in the eternal struggle. The dark horrors of myth and lore are coming. Once they found us easy prey, but this time we are ready. No longer will man cower before the ancient evils who threatened our ancestors. Never again will humanity be enslaved to the will of false deities so that we might be the fodder for their wars. Now is our time. We will take this fight to the heavens. We will show the eldritch beasts and beings from all the hells of our religions and fables what has become of humanity in their absence. And before weÃ‚Æ’??re through space itself will boil with the blood of titans and demons. Sons and daughters of Earth, prepare yourselves.

This is not just a fanfiction about the authors of the StopGame game portal. Although the game is packed to capacity with local memes and references, this is a completely independent story that will take you to a world where magic and technology coexist. The main character of StopGate finds himself in a very strange world and, together with the player, gets to know its customs, laws and, of course, inhabitants. All characters in the game are drawn in slightly different styles, because all authors on StopGame are different and individual in themselves. Before entering a world full of adventure, you will need to customize your character. You will be offered a choice of 7 unique races and 8 genders. Plus, you can choose your hero's magic ability. All of this will affect the game in one way or another. Or it won't. Game features Fully dynamic static environment The ability to play in the window Flexible configuration of window modes EsÃ‚Â¥Ã‚Âape key can skip the whole game Calling 'Menu' sometimes skips one line of dialogue The game is saved in random locations"

Through this practice, Apollyon , one may speak with them, make deals for power, capture them, or even project one's soul from their body entirely. The table can provide all of this, and it is all dangerous. Themes Apollyon can be considered a multiplayer choose-your-own adventure RPG, a roguelite, a strategy board game, and simply a story to enjoy . It is a narrative that develops with you, both in small arcs and large stories for character and table alike. Your choices will matter , but it is also forgiving, for while you can die, another practitioner may continue use of the table, and keep the tradition going, or even others at your very table! Characters There are ten characters to play, each with their own personal stories , which can be progressed in single or multiplayer! These will advance the character's skills and abilities, and generally make it easier and even possible, in some cases, to complete tougher Intentions , which are akin to quests and goals in Apollyon. Gameplay and Unlocks One will utilize obsidian tokens upon the Apollyic table to control various powers, and where they lie upon the table will influence the power in that direction, summoning or banishing spirits who favor said power. Spirits that approach the table must be dealt with, through violence, invocation, treaties, deception, or many other ways, also influenced by the tokens. You can also invoke spirits of your own, some of which you may bring between rituals , as well as other items to aide in the ritual, such as the Chronometer to keep time sane while projecting into the spirit world, or a brave ally who can aide you during the ritual. Additionally, Apollyon can be played with up to two friends , who will share the table's alignment, but will take on the burden or benefit of each spirit that approaches the table alone! This creates a unique strategy only present in multiplayer . Post-Release Apollyon is a narrative story that will shape with your choices, comprising 400,000+ words, but the final arcs of the main story and the individual character stories will come in frequent (weekly to bi-weekly) updates. These will be free of charge to those that purchase Apollyon! Additionally, player-made stories and spirits can be created, and even used in multiplayer, which will add to post-release content!

That is, apart from his arch enemy Lord Void, who will stop at nothing to dethrone him. The King lacks any meaningful construction skills so he needs you to build his castles for him, using nothing but the latest in cutting edge building materials including.. wood, stone and ... iron. You had better make them strong and sturdy too, because Void's loyal, cannon wielding minions will do all they can to destroy them, and send your King tumbling down to the cold, hard ground. Protect the King's gold coins and gunpowder stashes and he will reward you, but if he suffers because of your inadequate castle building skills he'll wuss out and surrender, or even worse.. die, meaning you'll see none of those glorious shiny things. Oh.. and whatever you do, be sure to keep those gunpowder barrels out of sight from the attackers, or your king will be taking a royal flight. Attack Mode Had enough of the King's high and mighty attitude? Take Lord Voids place and plan the attack on the King's castles yourself, before taking control of his minions and their devastatingly accurate (ish) cannons. Destroy the King's coin chests and you'll steal the contents, provided you make the King surrender or send him to his fate. Level Builder Want to make your own levels? Want to place the king at dizzying heights above a cluster of high explosive gunpowder barrels and create an explosion Michael Bay would be proud of?

Traverse underwater tunnels, huge open caverns, crystal caves, massive ravines, sulfur pools, deep pits, glow-worm lit grottos and much more! Echo Grotto uses subtle random generation to make every cave system feel unique, while still delivering amazing locations and deeply interconnected caves since every cavern and passage is handmade and uniquely designed. Each time you embark down into the caves of Echo Grotto you will never know whatÃ‚Æ’??s around the corner! Before you descend into a new cave system you can choose what gear you want to take with you. You might choose another locomotion method (like a grappling hook) or maybe an additional light source like a headlamp or lantern. Maybe you would rather take a snorkel with you so that you can reach the underwater portions of the caves? Or maybe a flare gun to easily light up things in the distance. There are many different tools to choose from! You can explore the caves using a unique teleportation system, where you throw a small Ã‚Æ’??teleporter lampÃ‚Æ’?? and you will be teleported to where it lands. This lamp will leave a trail of previous lamps behind you, resulting in a trail of lights that leads you back the way you came! Much like how cavers would leave a string behind them as they go, your teleporters leave a wire and trail of lights for you to retrace your steps. Another locomotion option is a pair of caving hooks, which you can use to freely 'grab and move' yourself around the environment! Choose to play as either an 'experience' or a 'game'. Choosing 'experience' will allow you to pick whatever gear you want from the start and simply explore the caves as you wish, while choosing 'game' will include a progression system, where you start with only basic tools and must search for more within the caves. It also employs a simple currency system, where you can use various gemstones found within the caves to get better tools! You can also play a range of special Ã‚Æ’??scenariosÃ‚Æ’?? which alter the gameplay in unique ways. For example, you can explore a flooded cave system, start the game from an alternative entrance or play with nothing but glowsticks! Some scenarios are like special challenges, like starting the game already deep into a cave system with only a candle (which will run out over time!). You will also find a range of cave-dwelling creatures in Echo Grotto. Keep an eye out for snails, eels and wetas! But if youÃ‚Æ’??re not a fan of creepy-crawlies you can always set which animals can be found in the caves (or even none at all). Go and see for yourself whatÃ‚Æ’??s deep in the caves of Echo Grotto!"

Though becoming smaller everyday, Keshia still enjoyed the time with BobbyÃ‚Æ’?ÃƒÂuntil one day, Bobby tripped on a crossbar and dropped his aluminum box on the sidewalk. The pain was enough for Bobby to forget the aluminum box and left. Keshia thus became just another forsaken rubbish on the side walk. Depressed, angered, and ERASAAAIED! Keshia picked up his companion Pencil and founded Knights Rubbish because why not? He planned to recruit other poor rubbish along his adventure. Wendy Floopy Combos Demo: Wendy Floopy was once the 6th installation floppy disk of a famous operating system. However, then came CDs, USB drives, and well, cloud downloads as replacements of floppies, so her owner Bobates the Software Engineer tossed her in the recycling box without another glimpse. Bored, WendyÃ‚Æ’??s biggest interest became collecting CDs in the recycling box. One day, Keshia Erasia, the founder of Knights Rubbish happened to pass by and fall in love with Wendy, but Wendy refused Keshia because he is ugly. Nonetheless, Wendy and Keshia still remained good friends, and Wendy became a crucial member in Knights Rubbish. Ranawato Plato Combos Demo: Ranawato Plato was once the most beloved plate of a famous philosopher, Bobus. As bad luck would have it, Bobus committed suicide due to the pain of existence. Ranawato then became an unused plate on the shelf (aka. rubbish). Overwhelmed by sad emotions, Ranawato dreamed of her deceased owner every nightÃ‚Æ’?ÃƒÂuntil one day, a handsome spoon came and introduced himself. Ranawato thus forgot her past owner and ran away with the spoon. It turned out that the spoon was not only handsome, but magical. Ranawato realized that she could actually communicate with the spoon by telepathy and the spoon could do a lot of magical tricks. Together, they roamed the world, performing magic tricks and impressed some depressed souls. The founder of Knights Rubbish, Keshia Erasia happened to be among the audiences in one of Ranawato and the spoonÃ‚Æ’??s magic show. Extremely spellbound by the show, Keshia recruited Ranawato as a member of Knights Rubbish. The spoon wasnÃ‚Æ’??t recruited because Keshia didnÃ‚Æ’??t like spoons, nonetheless, Keshia agreed that Ranawato carry the spoon anywhere she went. Othox Codox Combos Demo: -tASFdM Othox Codox was once a magic codex written by the famous sorcerer Bobbington. Unfortunately, Bobbington was executed because homosexuality wasnÃ‚Æ’??t legal then. All BobbingtonÃ‚Æ’??s precious publications were torn and ripped, some burnt in the merciless flames. Othox, though almost ripped into shreds, called for the Blessings of Rabimouchinus and granted a wheel chair to aid him. He practiced the magic written inside him as he ran away from the murderers and gradually became one of the greatest magic codex in the world.

Pick up your weapons, choose your classes (Mage, Archer, Warlock, Priest), team up with other players, and banish evil demons to protect the world! Game Feature Ã‚Æ’?Ã‚Â½ Extensive team cooperation and strategy Ã‚Æ’?Ã‚Â½ Unique and diverse classes and skills Ã‚Æ’?Ã‚Â½ Challenging and intriguing raids Ã‚Æ’?Ã‚Â½ Interaction with global players across different VR platforms Ã‚Æ’?Ã‚Â½ Loot collection and character development Ã‚Æ’?Ã‚Â½ Actual physical body movements in VR Classes and skills Age of Heroes involves multiple classes: mage, warlock, archer, priest, and warrior. The uniqueness of the classes creates opportunities for strategy and teamwork between players. Each class has its own skill set and development. By choosing different skills, you can create your own play style and create a character that best fits your own strategy and personality. At launch, 4 classes will be available: Mages are noble masters of the element power from the Energy Source. Mages can deal powerful Area of Effect (AoE) and slow enemies attacks. Archers are professionally-trained fighters who shoot volleys of arrows upon their foes. The faster the arrows are shot, the more damage they can inflict. Warlocks can summon mighty golems. Warlocks are drawn to the dark side of the Energy Source. They have mastered the way of fighting demons. Priests are the key supporters in a team. Their healing and resurrection skills are crucial in raids. After launch , we will add the warrior class: Warriors are tanks and have massive defensive abilities. Warriors are best suited for near or middle range attacks. Challenging and intriguing raids At launch, there will be 3 different raids: Hall of Death, Freezing Stronghold, and Fort of Horror. Each raid contains battles and bosses that require team cooperation and different raid strategies. Actual body movements In Age of Heroes, you need physical body movements like ducking or quick dodging to avoid darts and boss special abilities. Age of Heroes adapts for different room sizes, you can set different game configurations to complete all tasks with just slight movements for small rooms or change the configuration to use big movements for larger rooms. Physical movements are triggered when you see the alert on the ground or hear the NPC voice alert, then you know itÃ‚Æ’??s time to react. Loot and character development Players have a chance to loot scrolls that permanently enhance the skills of heroes after each battle. With different skill builds and team strategies, every single combat is a new fight. For example, the healing skill scroll will transform priestÃ‚Æ’??s healing skill from individual healing into group healing. This change frees your teammates from frequent hit-and-run so they can focus more on attack. Talk to your teammates to make team combat fun and effective!Ã‚Â¶ÃƒÂ¿ Play with heroes worldwide Age of Heroes includes single-player mode and multiplayer mode. In multiplayer mode, you may set up your own game or join an existing game. Each game allows a party of up to 5 players. The more players there are, the more difficult the game becomes! in addition, Age of Heroes supports cross-platform co-op. You can play it with players using either Vive or Oculus Rift. Also, you can use build-in audio chatting system to communicate with your teammates if your VR gear supports audio inputs. DLCs in the future New class DLC coming soon: A new class, warrior, will be added soon after launch. Warrior is the symbol of courage, loyalty and justice. They fight enemies in the front of the battle line and protect teammates by shields. With warrior, players can develop more team combat strategies. Leaderboards and achievements DLC After the new class DLC, leaderboards and achievements will be added to the game. In the achievements system, players can meet challenges in Age of Heroes and gain rewards. Personal space DLC In the third DLC, players will have their own personal space! Players can display their trophies and adjust their charactersÃ‚Æ’?? skills and talents in personal space."

Journey to a scenic arctic planet inhabited by experimental A.I. units and discarded robots. Play as Sleet, a sentient robot confronted with a series of puzzles and has little idea what's going on. Then meet Floe, an older A.I. unit, willing to help you proceed and unravel the mysteries of this beautiful desolate planet. Key Features Puzzle Variety: Recourse offers a content rich puzzle solving experience with more than 100 different elements. Length: It takes about 25-30 hours to finish the core game. Unlocking all possible secrets and achievements will take more depending on how good you'll become in the end. The core game consists of 14 large Puzzle maps in addition to 5 Payload and 5 Wave Rush levels. 3 Game Modes: Puzzle, Payload and Wave Rush (read more below). Character mobility: Dash, jet-boost, grapple, and fly your way around the levels to quickly reach any point. You are never ever limited to the ground. Unlockables: You can upgrade Floe, access new levels and if you manage to collect all golden question marks, you'll be awarded with the advanced modules for 'WINTER' - Floe's favourite weapon on the entire planet. Drop-In/Drop-Out Split-Screen Co-Op: A second player can seamlessly join or leave the game at any time to help you. Enemies: If you're ever bored of solving puzzles, you can dive into more action-packed game modes and battle your way through hordes of Failbots to unlock Floe's upgrades. Deployables : You can deploy eight different tools (Circular Saw, Incinerator, Tesla Coil, Laser, Vortex, Point A, Thumper and Singularity) to interact with the environment or counter enemies (find more information below). Environmental Hazards: It's not perfectly safe to wander around though. There are many hazards on the planet. Some of them can be turned on/off and even converted to your side. Color-coded Objects: Blue glowing objects are on your side. Orange glowing objects are on Failbots' side. Yellow glowing objects hate everyone. Achievements as Challenges: There are 53 achievements and many of them are rewarded upon the completion of a specific challenge. Challenges can be viewed at Floe's terminal. More to come: A free map pack is already in the works. It builds on the core game and introduces new puzzle elements and challenges. Small File Size: The total size of the game is less than 500 MB. It may come as a surprise as it's not even in the GBs. This was achieved through an integrated approach that combines good asset management, compression, 3D modelling and lighting features without giving up on production quality. Game Modes: There are three game modes in Recourse: Puzzle, Payload and Wave Rush which share elements but have different objectives. Each level contains a certain number of golden question marks that can be collected to ultimately unlock a mysterious weapon called Ã‚Æ’??WINTERÃ‚Æ’??. Puzzle Mode: The goal is to solve enough puzzles to reach the final checkpoint. Finishing puzzle levels unlock other game modes and levels. Puzzle levels are very peaceful: there are either very few or no Failbots that would disturb you. Payload Mode: Battle your way through armies of Failbots to collect their CPUs and deposit them to your wagon which must then be escorted to the finish line to complete the level. Deposited CPUs can be spent toward upgrading Floe. Wave Rush Mode: Failbots grow tougher with each wave. You can stay as long as you want or solve your way to the final checkpoint and complete the level when ready. Deployables: There are eight deployables that can be deployed to interact with the environment, solve puzzles and counter enemies. Each deployable applies damage in their own way. Circular Saw: Destroys crates (and more) blocking your way. Can be used to box in and damage Failbots. Incinerator: Burns enemies and affects heat-activated objects. Tesla Coil: A ranged tool that damages enemies with electric arcs. It also powers up sockets. Laser: Rotating lasers that damage characters and activate optical receivers. Vortex: Elevates and hurls enemies around. Powers wind-activated objects. Thumper: Screws itself to the floor and launches characters and physics objects in the air. Highly effective in launching enemies toward ceiling hazards or simply cause them falling damage. They can also break apart glaciers blocking your way. Point A: Teleports physics objects and characters to an activated Point B. Singularity: Pulls and traps enemies at its center. Can be used to turn slippery enemies into easy targets or pin them against environmental hazards. *"

The story line contains a lot of emotional and funny moments combined with tuff enemies! The game is a retro styled game , with simple mechanics as WASD to move it is very simple to learn and like but also very Very tuff in some levels , as the Developer , I really do like games in this style so this is why I decided to make one myself. Throughout the game you will meet a lot of people that you can talk to by simply pressing the W button , they will explain most of the story to you , also there are many cool bosses and enemies that use different and unique mechanics such as a flying machine that is triggered by you facing the other direction and running away from it or a huge boss that shoots rapid lasers at you , at the buttom line - I do really recommend the game to people who like the genre and I think you can have a lot of fun. So , What are you going to actually see in the game ? Throughout the game , you will be able to explore a deep world that contains many many things you can interact with , for example : if you find yourself with low health points and there is a bed in your room , you are free to use it whenever you want and your health will go up to the maximum. You are going to go through a tutorial in the first time you play the game that is going to explain exactly how to use the inventory , talk to people in the game and how to destroy your enemies too! When you will reach the harder levels of the game , you will find yourself spending a lot of time ttrying to beat that one enemy , for example a huge crowd of purple flies that flies after you and won't leave you until you eather kill them all or die. You can find some levels that also require a bit of thinking , just for example a level where you need to think about something to pick up from the ground and use it to crack open a jail door. Another thing you can find in this game is a small sub-story about betrayel , if you are going to reach a prrety high level in the game you will find out not everyone that you thought was on your side and you needed to help was that innocent and you will end up fightning againts someone you didnt even think about you will... As the developer and also a fan of games with old style , I really do recommend you to try out my game , it features basically any retro game feature with a special defference and I think you can really enjoy it."

The goal is to put each object in its place. A variation of a classic hidden object game. This game is not for everyone. There is only one level, the Victorian mansion. The objects are not very animated and there is no action scene. The pace is slow and there is no timer. This is not a home improvement game, even if you are fixing a house. It has been designed to promote concentration and peace of mind by allowing you to put every object in its place. You will appreciate it more if you are calm by nature and like to keep things organized. Amazing fix is Ã‚Æ’??Ã‚Æ’??categorized as a hidden object game, but it's not quite one. If you're a genre purist, you might not like the changes we've made to the gameplay. The game is designed to let you collect items by categories , not by individual item. You can choose to pick up whatever category you like to get started. Once you sign up for a category you will need to focus and find all the items that belong to that category. Most items will be easy to find, but some may be small or hide behind larger items. The game will give you a zoom function and hints to know where to look. You will need to learn to be strategic in what you choose to take out. It will be unsettling at first. The heart of the game starts at the most difficult level. With a little practice and by staying zen, you will often win. Each time you win, you will add new items to your inventory that will populate the mansion more on your next game. There are already hundreds of items to collect and we add more from time to time. There are several characters and monsters, most of them are wacky. It's not yet perfect, but when we add characters we try to make them diversified (age, size, origin, profession, etc.). If you love animals, there are over 75 to find in this category. We like to make subtle references to popular culture and add a touch of second-degree humor. Each game is different since the objects are placed randomly. The fun comes from going from a great chaos to a tidy house. Thanks for reading this description."

The hero (user) must solve numerous puzzles and deal with countless monsters to complete the operation. It combines adventure puzzles and RPG elements. Please find the introduction of the story below the following features: - We also had the story written as a novel, which might be available to you. - While it is essentially an adventure game, we incorporated lots of RPG elements to enrich the content of the game, like the drops of elixirs, herbs, potions, and mixtures. - As we know that a game must offer replayability in the future, we tried to randomize many things like enemies, objects, locations, characters, including the title songs, some dialogs, and other sounds. - Surrounding objects will offer many surprises that are randomized carefully. - We used highly diversified sound assets and voice-overs of all characters were done by carefully-selected artists with special skill in their profession. - Enemies are many and they have special melee or magic skills depending on their character or maybe boss. - We included numerous cut-scenes to tell the story nicely and enjoyably. - We incorporated special animations to people and monsters with different activities in line with the particular things they do, like mining. - We attached particular importance to the bosses. We wanted them to be a little different from classical bosses with supreme power and converted them into intelligent and interesting beings, ranging from the one who vomits similar but smaller monsters to the one who converts the objects in the interior of the castle into enemies and from the one who cooks enemies in a huge magic cauldron to the one who becomes the hero himself! - The game is assertive especially with its puzzles. Introduction of the story: (Excerpt from our novel) Chapter 1 Curse befallen Anyone who would take look at the view of the Castle of Seven Dunes could see it looked uglier, darker, and gloomier than a few weeks earlier, with its artisanal architecture and build made of the golden sands of the desert, following the fulminant curse spider-webbed all around the locale. One of the centers of happiness and justice in Seven Dunes had turned into chilling somberness behind the western walls of the town. The people of Seven Dunes were unwilling to see it any longer. In fact, no one was feeling like a bit of fresh air, coming outside from their homes that they were probably considering the safest place for the time being. The gate at the eastern walls was opening to a temple that looked a bit larger than the one a visitor of the town would expect, as a significant portion of the townsfolk was imprisoned or lost. The gate at the southern walls was the passageway of the people to an oasis where they could fulfill their needs of bathing, trading, breeding their livestock, and enjoying conversations with the foreign passersby of other kingdoms of the desert. The land beyond the northern walls did not offer much for a visitor as it was mere sand and endless view of the desert, despite the presence of a nice pavilion for public meetings situated on the northern dune, one of the seven dunes encircled by the walls, which were the inspiration for elders to name the town. The southern dune also had a pavilion on it, where Ande-ryn, the female Chief of the town, or other individuals met to govern the locale. Four of other dunes were home to the housing of the townsfolk, while the last one was used as the entrance to the castle in the west. There situated inns, merchants' workplaces, market, etc. as well as palm trees on the fords naturally formed between the dunes. In the middle of the night, one of the rooms somewhere in the castle was lit with numerous candlesticks. Seven Dunes, as always in lands dominated by deserts, more particularly the hot weather during daytime, was shinier and more cheerful at nights and recent days saw the townsfolk tired and less willing to enjoy things under the control of unknown beings. The room was the one where Princess Elryn, the Governor and Ruler of Seven Dunes, under the aegis of King Gorlough, her father who was in charge of all kingdoms and princedoms of the desert, was kept as a prisoner. Princess Elryn had fallen in love with Seven Dunes and wanted to lead her life there, in a visit her father paid together with her. Indeed, Seven Dunes was also home to the endless gold-colored sands of the desert but its proximity to the oasis and the small creek running from it, entering the town, and passing by the font side of the temple, were able to make the area fertile enough and the people continue living in peace. Now the princess was imprisoned in her own castle, in a part of it she even did not discern. That night, she wrote a letter to her father: Ã‚Æ’??Ã‚Æ’??My lord Seven Dunes is in danger! All of a sudden, some unknown creatures started to appear everywhere... They first imprisoned me in the depths of the castle. And made weird shapes on walls! They built their statues arbitrarily everywhere.... Wanting us to witness the presence of their vile shadow. In the desert, in the caves, in the gardens, even in my castle. They say they keep destroying everything in my kingdom... They occupied every nook and cranny. And inflicted undefinable damage and suffering on my people and my land. I do not know where they hide and attack hideously... And I also do not know where they emerge from. Please, Excellency, please help my people survive. Your force is my only chance and shelter. As always... Faithfully yours Princess Elryn Princess Elryn then stood and took the letter as well as a living thing that was not unfamiliar to the royal people of the region: a Crystalbird. She had bluish, bright, crystal feathers and body parts and was shedding more light than the torch on the walls of the room and the candlestick on the table of the Princess. Crystalbirds were one of the means of communication among nobles. Ã‚Æ’??How unfortunate it is that this is the only Crystalbird I have,Ã‚Æ’?Ã‚Â she thought to herself, fearing that the Crystalbird, vulnerable against cursed spells, might be lost forever in the skies. She tied the letter to one of the legs of and petted the bird who was content with any kind of affection like other animals. Wishing good luck for her people, the Princess released the Crystalbird into the cursed skies of Seven Dunes. With a slight halo of light behind her, the bird disappeared in the heavens."

The entire game has been recreated using a modern 3D engine to be as faithful to the original as possible.... Story: It is the thirty-eighth century. The fall of Earth is but a legend and humanity has migrated to a terraformed Mars. The Pentateuch, a group of five priests, rules the newly risen technocracy with an iron fist. In a bold attempt to eliminate the last of their political opponents, the five began the purgation trials. With guerrilla tactics their followers went about convicting those who would oppose them. To counter them an underground movement was initiated and an elaborate plan was conceived. A virus was spread throughout the circuit matrix. A thousand days from inception, the virus was scheduled to delete all personality files. The Ironseed Movement, as it was called, hoped that by stealing a ship they could escape... leaving behind Mars... and the Pentateuch. Their intent was to return after the fall of the technocracy. ...but a computer malfunction turned a thousand days into a thousand years... As the captain, you are awakened along with the crew by an alien horde. After a brief dialogue, communication is cut off and they attack. The game begins as the attack ends. Gameplay: The player begins with a single ship and a chosen crew. Planets are randomly generated and numerous ship designs and crew selection allow for different playing styles. Technology research, space exploration, resource management and gathering, production, crew management and alien diplomacy are essential elements. New ships, new upgrades, and ancient artifacts help the player in their efforts. Combat can be both in the form of random encounters or planned for by the player. Ironseed has been compared to Star Control, Starflight, Masters of Orion, Space Rangers, and Captain Blood. Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Adam Smith describes Ironseed as 'weird, trippy sci-fi that blew my tiny mind' and 'a little bit Space Rangers, a little bit Star Control and just a teensy bit FTL.'"

Each Chapter of the game uses the mechanics and idea of basketball in a different way. At one point you might be dribbling inside the intestines of a purple blob creature. At others, you're likely to be dunking above the clouds in front of the Parisian moon. A dynamic soundtrack and unique cardboard visuals help tell the story of a sister who must be saved through the power of basketball. Key Features Dunk, dribble, and crossover through 8 Chapters spanning throughout the impromptu courts of Paris Each Chapter takes the mechanics of basketball and applies them in different ways. Some chapters are more action, some are more puzzle. And then there are the strange chapters. Music is tied directly to the gameplay, though it's all passively controlled. For example, every time you dribble, you hear a bass hit. Shoot the ball, and the percussion stops. Visuals in the game are a unique mix of cardboard and color, every scene popping off the screen. Bonus Content Included with the game! :D The BasketBelle EP : Full Soundtrack + Bonus Tracks (MP3) + Cover Art BasketBelle sketchbook : Full-color PDF including sketches and liner notes Browser version of BasketBelle (playable on Mac and Linux as well, but not through the Steam launcher) Access to Making Of Featurette !

The trap is fraudulent in nature and requires your wits about you. The game has a bit of difficulty, so don't miss it if you like a challenge! All have 9 levels and one boss level."

MechRunner,2016-07-15,0.0,6.99,nan,,,,nan,nan,"MechRunner is an endless action game that casts you as a powerful mech in stunning cinematic battles against a relentless robotic army. Game Story On June 30th, 1908 a mysterious explosion took place over the Tunguska River in Siberia, Russia that wiped out trees and wildlife for over 800 square miles. To this day it remains the largest Ã‚Æ’??impact eventÃ‚Æ’?Ã‚Â in our planetÃ‚Æ’??s recorded history. In the years that followed, dozens of scientific expeditions to the site attempted to explain the disaster but failed to come to any conclusions. In the mid-1940s however, a team of scientists from the Russian secret service visiting the site stumbled upon the wreckage of an alien spacecraft containing technology that far exceeded our own. In the years that followed, the KGB set to work harnessing this mysterious new power source and created a new secret weapons program - The Division of Advanced Weaponry or 'O.S.O.' They thought they could control the new power theyÃ‚Æ’??d discovered, but it began to do more than run their machines. It began to drive the men working on it mad. The man in charge of the O.S.O., General Yuri Petrakoff, seemed particularly affected and on April 14th, 1949, Petrakoff launched a full scale assault on Europe. One of PetrakoffÃ‚Æ’??s lead engineers, Jesper Teterev, went AWOL and left the program early, wary of what was happening there. He went to live in secret with his sister, Isabel and niece, Allison. While in hiding however, Jesper (with the help of budding engineer and pilot Allison) was busy building his own mechanized war machine, called the XP-41, certain it may be needed one day to stave off the O.S.O.'s evil creations. He was right. Gameplay MechRunner is an endless-style action game mixed with fast and furious mode-changing mech action! It is a 'runner' in that the player is constantly moving forward while tracking down lethal O.S.O. forces but what makes it special is that youÃ‚Æ’??re piloting a giant robot capable of some serious destruction! Other endless runners feature action elements, but none like this. Heat seeking missiles, heavy caliber bullets, laser cannons, and concussion bombs meet destructible buildings, debris littered streets, and tons of slice-able enemies to create a fast paced, visually stunning experience!

In real time the player must escape from the maze of enemies with limited sight. To make things more difficult, in each level the player must activate a switch which will power the elevator to the next floor. A variety of enemies makes each level it's own challenge. The Story Have you ever heard of Montana's Croatoa? They say the myth started as a fairy tale to keep children out of the abandon mines. But as with every fairy tale, there is an origin to it. In 1950, a mining community north of Helena, MT just up and vanished. The offical report was that there was a gas leak inside the mine that caused the entire facility to be closed. But there's one missing part in that report, how did they abandon the mine if they never left? Follow the story of the only survivor of Montana's Croatoa. The Weaponized Strains and Infections The Reanimation Strain The concept came from the fungi that reanimates dead ants, known as the Ophiocordyceps unilateralis. This fungi was spliced with dandelion dna which led to a fast reproducing reanimation strain without the fungi extremties. When paired with a virus that turns the infected victim's immune system against itself, a very deadly localized strain is developed. The Vine Strain The vine strain is based after the weed known as morning glory, these strains have hardened tips and will pierce further into you than the claws of the basic reanimated. The Flytrap Strain The flytrap strain is derived from the plant known as the venus flytrap. The flytrap is slow and easy to dodge, but if the target is slowed or in the dark, makes for a perfect ambush. The Spore Shooter This advanced strain needs no sustiance to sproute. It fires spores in four directions and waits until it hears the spores hit to fire again. The Spiders Spiders that have been infected with the basic strain, be cautious around them. They are faster than you and if you are bit by one, you will eventually die. The Pollen Spreader This strain is based after the basic dandelion has gone to seed. Every second a target breathes in the pollen the harder it becomes to take the next breath. Soon the body begins to attack itself quickly killing the target. Once attacked the Spreader juts out thorns that impales the attacker. The GUI In the upper right corner are lights that will tell you: if the elevator has been powered, if you have picked up the ingame object, and if you can overcharge your headlamp for temporary more sight. In the middle of the screen is the current time spent in level In the upper left corner of the screen is the current best time ingame, 9999.99 means the level hasn't been beaten yet.

Command a squad of 4 prototypes to protect the Mainframe from infection by an unknown virus. You will have to fight off assaults, destroy fabricators, download valuable data, clear infected nodes, and much more on your way to the deepest areas of the complex. Bypass the limitations and disadvantages of items and create powerful combinations. Destroy opponents with a variety of tactics: overheat them, destroy them with corrosion, absorb damage and shoot back.Don't rely on a single strategy - enemies may have a way to counter it. The Prologue content: 6 of 24 mechs, 90 of 190 items, 1/3 of missions (1 act). * RETRO STYLE: Graphics, inspired by 80s terminal PC with hybrid synthwave soundtrack. * DIVERSE TACTICS: Cook enemy robots to death, bury them under your bullets, eliminate with a single powerful shot, or render your opponents useless with debuffs - this game is designed with a lot of viable strategies in mind. * BUILD YOUR SQUAD: Similar to how in card games you have to build your deck, in Mainframe Defenders you have to combine different items with unique abilities, to create an unstoppable squad. Work with item drawbacks or double down on them, creating flawed, yet powerful build! * UNIQUE ENEMIES: Enemy squad won't sit idle, though. Each unit has its own role in the squad and designed to counter certain strategies. Pick your targets wisely, or you will lose. * PROCEDURAL LEVELS: Hand-made rooms are combined with procedural generation to create random levels. Missions have differing objectives, combined with unique mission conditions. Will you accept the challenge or avoid the unknown and risk falling behind? * PROGRESSION SYSTEM: Victory or defeat, the game is not over yet! Unlock new units, each with a unique set of upgrades and load-outs. Unlock new items to bolster your new strategies. Synthetic Domain is a small team of hobbyists with a passion for making games.

Roguelike Every map you enter is brand new. The monsters in each level game instance are randomly generated. Each card acquired in the initial game stage is random, and you can even get a purple hero directly at the beginning. Adventure There are many types of plots in the game for players to enter, including monsters, elite monsters, shops, lucky wizards, profiteers, purchasers, etc. Each plot corresponds to a different function, and players need to make the best route selection based on their current conditions. Planning ahead and thinking about the next few steps in advance will help you achieve the maximum benefit. Battle The battle mode adopts rules similar to the auto chess gameplay. Monsters have different attributes, skills, occupations, etc. Three or six different characters of the same profession play at the same time and connect to form a faction, which can trigger the unique professional skills of that faction. In addition, collocating reasonable equipment for different characters is also one of the major features of the game. The different coordination of characters, occupations, and equipment often causes some fantastic chemistry reactions in the battle lineup. Classic Lineup Chaser professions carry weapons such as poison darts and golden hatchet, which can break the restriction that ordinary attacks hit only one person, so as to attack repeatedly the rival lineup. The wizard profession carries equipment like a wizard's staff and a wizard's broom that triggers stuns and combo attacks, which can often prevent enemies from making moves. The assassin profession carries equipment with a high critical strike rate, which can break through the enemy's line of defense and completely defeat the enemy's rear line. More special gameplay combinations are left for you to explore by yourself."

For example, there are numerous city gates in the capital, Someones are huge and famous like Dan Feng gate, Zhu Que gate, while other smaller ones like Chun Ming gate, Guang Hua gate. Their appearances, positions are referenced by academic materials. 3 imperial palaces in Chang'an. There are 3 imperial palaces in Chang'an: The Da Ming Palace, the Tai Ji Palace and the Xing Qing Palace, I spend much time in their reconstruction, especially the Da Ming Palace, which still stands its ruin in a historical park.

In the meantime your workers will build your designs and carry out the day-to-day tasks in your factory. You can let them carry resources from and to the machines as is needed or you can choose to automate the process by using belts, splitters, mergers, containers... As you progress, you will need to upgrade your infrastructure to include faster belts and more capable machines in order to build ever more complex items. An in-game planning tool can assist you in figuring out what you need to build a particular item.

Everything can be mined. Enjoy crafting, building, and fully automating your survival in this strange world. New in Version 0.00: Voxel mining! All features listed here have been implemented, but may be subject to change. Game Basics: Many things can be crafted that inherit properties of the material used to craft them Mine Ores by hand with a Pickaxe or by machine, fully automating mining, smelting, and crafting Pick up and move Ore with a Pry Bar to condense your base (your Pry Bar needs to be at least as hard as the Ore to not destroy it) Local grid-based building allows most items to snap into place Basics of Factory Building: Machines are first crafted, then placed, some machines like Miners function differently depending on the metal used to make it Generators generate power from an energy source, including fuel and solar Power Boxes route power underground automatically to nearby machines and other Power Boxes You can use Platforms made from different metals to isolate power grids from one another Machines need enough available power to function Battery Backups can be used to store extra power being generated and supplement the grid when more power is needed Conveyors connect to a machine's ports and can either give or take items, depending on the Conveyor direction Multiple Conveyors can attach to the same port and to each other, allowing for splitting and merging functionality Storage Racks hold items from Conveyors and can output items as well Filters can be attached to machine ports to only output certain items Getting Started and Progression: A Pickaxe is made by first crafting a Pickaxe Head and a Tool Handle . Press E or (Back) to open the Crafting Menu Click on an item/icon in the Crafting Menu to see its recipe Click and drop inventory items into your hotbar to rearrange them You can find materials to make a basic Pickaxe laying on the ground. Press F or (X) to pick them up When night falls you'll need to craft a Bed , or wait it out using the flashlight in your Scanner to see Beds require Cotton , found on plants growing near water The terrain can be mined for Stone , Dirt , and Sand Once you have a Pickaxe , you can try to find Ores laying around (some Ores are found underground!) Use the Scanner to determine an Ore's hardness and type Harder Ores require harder Pickaxes to mine efficiently (same applies to Miner machines) If you encounter a Coppie (jumpy treasure chest) he's probably just hungry Once you smelt the Ore Piles in a Furnace, you can set about making new tools, machines, or a base in which to settle down A basic automatic mining/smelting setup will need a Generator , Power Box , Miner , Smelter , Storage , and some Conveyors Have fun playing!

However, the true motivations of the engineer hide hidden secrets. Such a mystery is marked by resentment, obsession, and lust. THE CONTEXT A dangerous military scientist obsessed with his dead wife decides to recreate her in a laboratory. However, that decision will destroy the world. An apocalyptic wind destroys 90% of the population, leaving the rest obsessed with sex. Only Sonya, but known as Hardpunch can survive in this world. It absorbs energy when having sex. The survivors of this world worship a goddess called 'Venus'. In fact, Venus is one of the clones of the mad colonel's wife. The colonel is actually an immortal. In the past, his wife was murdered by a demon. The colonel goes crazy and spends his whole life rebuilding his wife. Without knowing it, it creates a lethal virus with extreme sexual appetite. Harpunch becomes the only hope in this subversive world. As a clone, she can survive the violent sexual libido of the source of pleasure. That fountain is still alive thanks to the mad colonel. A Venus-worshiping sect created beings known as Spoils. These creatures produce strong sexual energy when they have sex. They are not dangerous. They practically have sex or masturbate constantly. The problem is the mutants that protect the spoils. Mecazombies, also known as carcasses. Sonya Rubra was one of the clones who managed to escape the colonel's laboratory. This happened during the cataclysm that destroyed almost the entire human race. Such a cataclysm turned the remaining humanity into freaks. In this world, there are no children because reproduction does not exist. Only explicit sex. Hardpunch found that she could become the host of Venus if she absorbs as much energy as she can with spoils. THE MISSION In the future, the last clone manages to transport itself to the past in order to destroy the dangerous engineer before the virus is created and spread across the world. This new version has the characteristics of Venus. However, the transfer was mental, unlike the other quantum leaps that were performed previously. Then, Venus' soul occupies the body of one of the most formidable clones developed by the engineer. The EML model. Also known as 'indestructible lady'. The player explores an open world in the first person. It is necessary to survive until the end. In other words, find the portal of triumph and cross it to transport yourself to a new world. During this challenge, it is important to collect items of all types (health, stamina, bladed weapons, etc.). There are no firearms in this future. Practically the weapons available are swords, knives, and shields. After all, there are spoils. Dying humans are kept on platforms in order to provide energy. Whoever has the power to absorb through sex is supplied in these places. However, there will always be a creature protecting these posts. The main objective is to obtain enough sexual energy to activate the powerful Alive-Bomb that is hidden in the last level of the game. This machine could become the only hope for this world lost to nuclear cataclysm. Playing is extremely easy because you can use your computer's keyboard and mouse or you can choose a joystick. This game is for PC Windows and is not heavy to play. The interface offers a lot of gameplay information. In addition, you can count on the help of a complete inventory."

In 1984, Crist City passed the law about the private prison. According to the law, the government should Ã‚Æ’??sellÃ‚Æ’?Ã‚Â the prison to the company which offers the highest price. At the end of 1994, you became a warden of The Pompeii Prison which is located in Black Cloud district. As a warden of a private prison, your responsibilities include making plans about the whole prison and solving inmatesÃ‚Æ’?? all kinds of problems such as power supply, waste disposal and prisonersÃ‚Æ’?? need for food, water and accommodation. As a matter of course, the prisoners are concerned about these problems. If the warden doesnÃ‚Æ’??t provide leisure facilities, some prisoners may not focus on their work or even cause terrible acts which lead to riots, jailbreaks or suicides. Build different kinds of workshops to keep your prisoners working hard and earning money from the market. You can produce nearly 100 different goods from workshops which include drugs, Gatlin or even RPG. There are six main workshops (clothing, furniture, electric equipment, handcrafts, chemicals and firearms). You can sell those goods at the market and of course clothes and weapons are available for use. Find the specially skilled prisoners from the government and police database, and make those people work in your prison. These professional criminals such as thieves, robbers, hackers, killers, bombers and fighters can undertake some Ã‚Æ’??special missionsÃ‚Æ’?Ã‚Â for you. Those special tasks include breaking into a bank vault, robbing a jewellery store, kidnapping and blackmailing some wealthy merchants. Tailors, carpenters, technicians, chemistry professors and artists can work in different workshops according to their specialty and you can have them make valuable goods from raw materials. Lawyers, bookkeepers, actors, former police officers, singers, chefs and other Ã‚Æ’??talentsÃ‚Æ’?Ã‚Â can work in your prison as advisers. They can have negative influences on your prison. Work as the warden to unlock different projects. Time your selling at the right time at the market. Make more money to expand your prison empire and use money to influence politicians and gangs in the city. The warden can increase his skill points by developing daily work. These points can be used to unlock a new project which could be useful to your prison and allows you to make more money. Prices of goods and materials will change every day. As a warden, you need to find the best moment to buy the materials with the lowest price and sell the goods with most profit. There are also many gangs and criminal organisations in Crist City that will come to you to seek cooperation, trade and even help. When you make friends with some gangs, they may sell you some rare materials or even help you at important time. Obviously, there will be street gunfights between the gangs and some gangs may be eliminated by the others. It requires of your making balance between various gangs to avoid one gangÃ‚Æ’??s domination of the cityÃ‚Æ’??s streets. If there is only one gang in the city, it may have a negative impact on your prison. You live in the Crist City so try to have a look at every store on the street. You can buy magazines which can increase your skill points and condoms at the grocery or convenience store, but you still need to be careful as there are still venereal diseases and AIDS exist in the game. You can change your hairstyle in the barbershop. You can eat different kinds of food such as Peking roast duck, cheeseburger, spaghetti, borscht, Japanese sushi and even Chinese snacks at various restaurants in the Crist City. You can order a glass of Bourbon in a nightclub or have a bottle of wine. You can stay at hotels which could increase your stamina and improve your physical condition. Drink a cup of coffee, listen to the Prelude 1007 from BachÃ‚Æ’??s Cello Suite, enjoy the peace of the life. Museums, theatres and aquariums require tickets. These places can light up your mood. Of course, benches in the park are free. You can also have some fun at the nightclub with dancers and enjoy special services in the massage parlours, and even do illegal things in the foot spa centre."

Comments help us to reference our game to continue the 'PAGO FOREST' trilogy. Thanks to your contributions, our license still exists! We're counting on you! ' The first of its kind, 'Pago's Forest' is an educational game: you improve your grammar through the discovery of a heroic fantasy tale. (English version) The spelling lessons are sometimes disheartening. That's why we offer you today not only a learning of the fundamental rules of spelling but also a real role-playing game with animations and graphics to the taste of video game enthusiasts (from 8 years old). A trilogy seemed necessary to us in order to cover the field of grammatical spelling, in particular the subject/verb chords in conjugation. 'Pago's Forest: The Dragon's Revenge' is the first part of this trilogy. It focuses mainly on the present tense. This first part emphasizes : - the simple present tense (including that of the auxiliaries 'to be' and 'to have') - the present progressive - the present perfect simple - the present perfect in -ing - the agreement between the conjugated verb and its subject - how to easily find a conjugated verb in a sentence and its infinitive - how to easily find the right subject - identify the people in the conjugation - recognize different pronouns. In case of an error, a help box will appear. After three errors, the story can no longer progress, the player must redo the level and improve his spelling if he wants to know the rest. At the end of each level, the concepts mentioned are shown or reviewed. A lexicon can be consulted at any time in order to facilitate the understanding of the text. A trilogy is in preparation. It will deal with other aspects of history and spelling. History In the village of Pago nestled in the forest, Flora lives in peace with her relatives. Suddenly, a dragon attacks the village and destroys it by fire. Why did the dragon choose Pago as its target? Flora doesn't know. Her search for the truth will lead her to find lost friends and confront the dangers that surround her. In this heroic fantasy world, we discover unusual landscapes and role-playing characters such as mages, dwarves, warriors, dragons and many others."

What does that mean? In KotS you go on dungeons runs with a single card. Before entering the castle you can choose which card you want to take. These card can be cheap, weak ones like 'Worm', or powerful hard-to-get cards like 'Lobster'. During your run you go through rooms in which half of the time you'll encounter an enemy with which you'll have to do a turn-based battle. Enemies in this game are cards of other players that have died in that spot. This also means that if you lose this battle, your card will become an enemy as well! While fighting through the castle you'll also find chest with valuable loot: - different types of shell to buy new (better) cards - badges that you can attach to cards that will give them active or passive abilities Halfway each area you can choose to go to a different, deeper area. At the end of each area there is a boss card waiting for you, defeat this card and your card will automatically become the boss in that area. If you become the boss at least once in every area (except the first main area) you'll be rewarded with the 'key badge'. If a card carries the key badge they will be able to open the door at the end of the first main area 'The Hallway' and pass through to the final hidden area the 'Throne Room'. If you become the boss there, you'll be the one and only, King of the Sandcastle! Only 1 player can be king at a time!
